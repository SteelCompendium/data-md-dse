###### Level 10 Role Advancement Ability

<!-- -->
> 🏹 **Mazed (Encounter)**
>
> | **Magic, Ranged, Strike** |     **Main action** |
> | ------------------------- | ------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**          | **🎯 One creature** |
>
> **Power Roll + highest characteristic:**
>
> - **≤11:** 7 damage; if the target has M < WEAK they are mazed (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 11 damage; if the target has M < AVERAGE they are mazed (save ends)
> - **17+:** 16 damage; if the target has M < STRONG they are mazed (save ends)
>
> **Effect:** While mazed, the target is dazed. Additionally, at the end of each of the mazed target's turns, the retainer can cause the target to move up to their speed in a straight line in a direction of the retainer's choice. This is not forced movement, and the movement ends if it would cause the target to enter difficult or damaging terrain.
