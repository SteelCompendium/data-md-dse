###### Exploding Mill Wheel (Level 3 Siege Engine Artillery)

A massive wooden wheel is loaded with explosives and rolled toward enemy forces or fortifications, ready to explode.

- **EV:** 10
- **Stamina:** 25
- **Size:** 2

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Deactivate**
>
> As a maneuver, a creature adjacent to an exploding mill wheel that isn't rolling can make an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** The creature accidentally activates the **Roll the Wheel** ability.
> - **12-16:** The exploding mill wheel is deactivated but the creature is slowed (EoT).
> - **17+:** The exploding mill wheel is deactivated and can't be used.
>
> Once the wheel is rolling, it can't be deactivated. However, it can be exploded early by destroying it or blocking its movement with a suitably large creature or object.

> 🌀 **Roll the Wheel**

> | **Area**       |         **Main action (Adjacent creature)** |
> | -------------- | ------------------------------------------: |
> | **📏 Special** | **🎯 Each creature and object in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** When this ability is used and at the start of every turn thereafter, the exploding mill wheel rolls, moving 2 squares in a straight line. Each creature and object of size 2 or smaller in the area defined by the wheel's movement is targeted by the following power roll. A target force moved this way is moved to either side of the wheel, as the Director determines.
>
> **Power Roll + 2:**
>
> - **≤11:** 5 damage; push 1
> - **12-16:** 9 damage; push 2
> - **17+:** 12 damage; push 3
>
> If the wheel enters the space of any creature or object of size 3 or larger, or if it is reduced to 0 Stamina, its movement stops and it explodes. Each creature and object in a 5 burst centered on the wheel is targeted by the following power roll.
>
> - **≤11:** 5 damage; push 1; M < 0 burning (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 9 damage; push 2; M < 1 burning (save ends)
> - **17+:** 12 damage; push 3; M < 2 burning (save ends)
>
> A burning creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of their turns. A burning object takes 1d6 fire damage at the end of each round.

> ⭐️ **Upgrade**
>
> **Piloted (+4 EV)** The wheel has been fitted with a control mechanism and a pilot's seat for a creature of size 1M or smaller. As a move action, the pilot can turn the wheel in any direction while it is moving. As a main action, the pilot can leap out of the pilot's seat, landing in an adjacent space while the wheel continues moving in a straight line.
>
> Without proper training, determining how to pilot the wheel requires a **Reason test**.
>
> - **≤11:** The wheel immediately explodes as if striking a size 3 or larger creature or object.
> - **12-16:** The creature fails to pilot the wheel.
> - **17+:** The creature can pilot the wheel.
>
> On a natural 19 or 20, a creature can both pilot the wheel and can disarm its explosives as a maneuver.
