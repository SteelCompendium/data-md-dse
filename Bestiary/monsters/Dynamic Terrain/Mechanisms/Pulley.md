###### Pulley (Level 1 Trigger Support)

A counterweighted pulley system can be used to quickly ascend to the top of a wall, scaffold, tower, or other structure.

- **EV:** 1
- **Stamina:** 1
- **Size:** 1S

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Deactivate**
>
> As a maneuver, a creature adjacent to a pulley can make an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** The creature triggers the pulley.
> - **12-16:** The pulley is deactivated but the creature is slowed (EoT).
> - **17+:** The pulley is deactivated and doesn't trigger.

<!-- -->
> ❕ **Activate**
>
> A creature adjacent to the pulley uses a maneuver to release the pulley.
>
> **Effect:** The triggering creature is lifted to the top of the structure the pulley is attached to. The pulley must be manually reset.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Climbable**
>
> A creature adjacent to the pulley can climb its ropes with an **easy Agility test** to ascend to the top of the structure it's attached to.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Upgrade**
>
> **Looped Chain (+1 EV)** Instead of a rope and pulley, the system uses a counterweighted looped chain. A looped chain automatically resets and can be triggered repeatedly.
