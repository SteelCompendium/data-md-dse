> **Network (+1 EV per hidey-hole)** The hidey-hole is connected to a tunnel network. A creature familiar with the network can move from one hidey-hole to any space adjacent to a connected hidey-hole if they have movement available equal to the straight-line distance to that space. A creature unfamiliar with the network can use a maneuver to make a **hard Intuition test** to discover a connected hidey-hole.
