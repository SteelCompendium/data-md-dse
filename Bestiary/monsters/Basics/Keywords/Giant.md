###### Giant

Creatures with the Giant keyword include ogres and trolls, as well as fire giants, frost giants, hill giants, and stone giants. Giants have similar body shapes to humanoids, but they're much larger. Despite that similar appearance, these creatures have no relation to most humanoids (other than the mighty hakaan).
