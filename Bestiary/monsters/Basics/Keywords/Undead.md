###### Undead

Undead creatures, such as ghosts and zombies, are the reanimated flesh and spirits of once-living creatures who have died. Their level of sapience is determined by the creator or effect that brought them back from the dead. Some undead function entirely on their own, while others mindlessly seek to harm the living if given no other instructions. Unless otherwise noted, undead don't need to eat, drink water, sleep, or breathe to survive.
