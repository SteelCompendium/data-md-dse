# Retainers

A retainer is a type of NPC follower who fights alongside the heroes. Retainer creatures can gain levels just as heroes do, so their battlefield contributions remain relevant as the heroes grow in status and power. A lowly level 1 goblin guide can advance up to level 10 if they adventure with a heroic party for long enough!

The stat blocks in this chapter have the Retainer type next to their level and role. For example, a goblin guide is a level 1 harrier retainer. Some retainers, such as the human warrior or the time raider mind healer, are members of playable ancestries. Others, such as the minotaur gorer, are more monstrous in nature. Additionally, the rules in this chapter allow for the creation of new retainers using nearly any monster as a base creature.

A retainer is a follower of a specific hero. This hero is called the retainer's mentor, and their player controls that retainer in battle. Each player can control only one retainer at a time. If a hero ever acquires more than one retainer, all but one of those are considered to be working at the party's stronghold or performing some function at the periphery of any battle, not contributing meaningfully to its outcome.

#### Sidekicks, Not Stars

Retainers are useful allies, but the heroes are always the stars of the show! Retainers are simply there to pitch in and make the heroes look good.

Retainers are simpler to run than heroes. They have fewer abilities and fewer resources to manage. Usually, a retainer makes one power roll per turn and then gets out of the way. But while a retainer's turn is quick, it can be tactically interesting! Besides dealing damage, a retainer's abilities often benefit their mentor or allow the mentor to do interesting things.

Because a retainer acts on their mentor's turn, they allow the heroes' side of an encounter to have two characters act in sequence without having to use any special abilities, providing a significant tactical advantage.

#### Gaining Retainers

In many cases, heroes gain retainers as they acquire character features. For instance, a hero might gain a retainer from a title, a complication, or some other element of the game. When a player earns Renown, they might be able to choose a retainer as a new follower.

At other times, the events of the story can dictate that a retainer joins the party. When the heroes rescue a prisoner or befriend a former rival, you might decide that the NPC joins the party, becoming a retainer of one of the characters.

Any hero gaining a retainer is always at your discretion. If something in the rules grants a specific retainer, you can always substitute another retainer who works better for your campaign.

#### Retainers Leaving the Party

A retainer doesn't need to always travel with the heroes. When they're not called on to adventure, they can remain behind at the party's stronghold or otherwise live their own life. Even when they're not present, they're still considered to be a retainer and a member of the party.

However, there might be cases when a retainer leaves the party permanently. Retainers aren't invulnerable, so they can be killed in battle. But they can leave under less extreme circumstances as well. If the events of an adventure set a retainer against their mentor, or if the retainer's story naturally comes to an end, you and the players can decide it's time for the retainer to ride off into the sunset. The characters might meet their former adventuring buddy again as a friendly NPC, though-or perhaps as a foe!

#### Retainers in Combat

When using retainers in combat, a number of special rules should be kept in mind.

- **Another Hero:** A retainer counts as an additional hero of their current level for the purpose of encounter building (see Step-by-Step Encounter Building).
- **Part of a Mentor's Turn:** A retainer takes their turn as part of their mentor's turn. For the purpose of effects that end at the end of the retainer's turn, or any other rules elements that depend on the start or end of a creature's turn, the start and end of the mentor's turn is also the start and end of the retainer's turn.
- **Hero Can't Act:** If a hero can't act on their turn (because they are unconscious, for example), their player can still control the hero's retainer.
- **Retainer Action Economy:** On their turn, a retainer can take a move action, a maneuver, and a main action, just like a hero.

Recoveries: A retainer has 6 Recoveries.

- **Death:** A retainer can become dying at 0 Stamina and die at negative half their Stamina, just like a hero.
- **Surges:** Whenever a retainer gains surges, those surges are gained by their mentor, with the mentor and retainer sharing surges. The retainer spends surges the same way a hero can, but the extra damage granted to them by spending a surge is equal to their mentor's highest characteristic score.

#### Retainer Advancement

A retainer doesn't earn Victories or gain XP. Instead, they usually have the same level as their mentor. When a character acquires a retainer, the retainer starts out at that mentor character's level. Thereafter, each time a mentor gains a level, all their retainers attain the same level, whether they are actively adventuring with the hero or not.

If a character somehow acquires a retainer with a level higher than their own, the retainer doesn't lose levels, but they don't gain any new levels until their mentor's level exceeds their own.

#### Advancement Features

A retainer creature's stat block includes characteristics, a level, a role, one or more abilities including a signature ability, and other standard monster features. This stat block represents the retainer's statistics at their lowest level. The retainer's statistics improve as they gain levels, as shown on the Retainer Advancement table.

The number of levels a retainer can gain depends on their starting level. For instance, a devil defector starts at level 5, and so can gain only 5 levels before reaching level 10. If the level noted in a retainer's stat block is higher than 1, they don't gain advancement benefits for any levels up to and including their starting level. As a higher-level creature, similar bonuses are already baked into their statistics.

Retainer advancement benefits are broken out as follows:

- **Characteristic Increase:** At level 2, a retainer increases one of their characteristic scores by 1 (to a maximum of 2). At level 5, they increase each of their characteristic scores by 1 (to a maximum of 3), and at level 8, they increase one characteristic score by 1 (to a maximum of 4). For each single-characteristic increase, the player of the retainer's mentor chooses which characteristic to use.
- **Free Strike Damage Bonus:** The retainer gains a +2 damage bonus to free strikes at level 3, at level 6, and at level 9.
- **Advancement Abilities:** A retainer gains new abilities at levels 4, 7, and 10 (unless the retainer's starting level is that level or higher). Each retainer stat block is accompanied by retainer advancement abilities specific to that retainer. Whenever a retainer would gain a new advancement ability, instead of choosing their retainer ability, the player of their mentor can instead choose a role advancement ability that matches their role and level. (Advancement abilities for each type of creature role are detailed in the next section.)
- **Stamina Bonus:** At each level, a retainer gains a +9 bonus to Stamina.
- **Signature Ability Damage Increase:** A retainer's signature ability is unique in that it grows stronger as the retainer advances in level. Only the retainer's signature ability improves this way! The table features two columns for a retainer's signature ability damage bonus-one for a tier 1 power roll outcome and one for a tier 2 or tier 3 outcome. A retainer's signature ability gains a +1 damage bonus every second level for a tier 1 outcome, and every level for a tier 2 or tier 3 outcome.

##### Advancement Example

A 4th-level hero convinces a goblin guide, a level 1 harrier retainer, to join the party. The goblin guide immediately jumps to level 4. For level 2, the guide increases their Agility by 1. For level 3, the guide gains a +2 damage bonus to their free strikes. For level 4, the guide chooses between the level 4 retainer advancement ability Weaving Knives or the level 4 harrier advancement ability Tackle (see below).

Additionally, for jumping from level 1 to level 4, the guide gains a +27 bonus to Stamina, giving them Stamina 48. Their signature ability gains a +2 damage bonus on a tier 1 outcome (for a total of 5 damage), and a +3 bonus on a tier 2 outcome (8 damage) or a tier 3 outcome (10 damage).

#### Encounter Abilities

Some retainer abilities have the Encounter keyword. Once a retainer uses an encounter ability, they can't use that ability again until their mentor earns a Victory.

#### Custom Retainers

This book includes more than a dozen retainer stat blocks with advancement information. But most creature stat blocks can be turned into retainers, provided a creature isn't a minion, a leader, or a solo. You have the final say over whether a player can choose a specific creature as a custom retainer.

To turn a creature into a custom retainer, start with the creature's stat block. Instead of the Stamina noted in the stat block, a custom retainer has 21 Stamina at level 1. Then use the Retainer Advancement table as a guide to adjusting the creature's statistics as they increase in level, including starting at higher than level 1.

If the creature's signature ability affects an area or targets more than one creature or object, the ability now only affects one target within distance. A custom retainer has no retainer advancement abilities, so they must take the role advancement ability specific to their level and role. Custom retainers can't use any abilities or effects that require Malice.

##### Advancement Example

A 4th-level hero trains a striped condor griffon, a level 2 elite brute, gaining that noble creature as a retainer. The griffon starts as a level 2 retainer. They have Stamina 30 (21 for level 1 and a +9 bonus for being level 2). Because they started at level 2, they don't gain any level 2 benefits or advancement features from the Retainer Advancement table.

At level 3, the griffon gains a +2 damage bonus to their free strikes, a +9 bonus to Stamina (giving them Stamina 39), and a +1 damage bonus to their signature ability for a tier 2 or tier 3 outcome. At level 4, the griffon gains the level 4 brute ability Big Windup (see Big Windup), another + 9 bonus to Stamina (for Stamina 48), and a +1 damage bonus to their signature ability for all tier outcomes. This gives them a total damage bonus to their signature ability of +1 for tier 1 outcomes and +2 for tier 2 and tier 3 outcomes.

#### Role Advancement Abilities

When a retainer reaches level 4, 7, or 10, they can gain one of the following abilities based on their role, rather than gaining the retainer advancement ability presented alongside their stat block. A retainer qualifies only for the role advancement ability that matches their role and level.

If a role advancement ability has the Magic or Psionic keyword, a retainer can swap the Magic keyword for Psionic or vice versa. They can also lose the keyword if they can achieve the ability's effects through gadgetry, martial prowess, or other nonsupernatural means.
