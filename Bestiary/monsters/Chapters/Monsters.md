## Ajax the Invincible

"On behalf of the college, I would like to thank Lord Alvaro for his excellent lecture. The whole school owes you a debt for donating your time today. We will now open the floor to questions. Before we do, I would like to remind you that we enjoy a certain amount of informality here at the war college, but when speaking to Lord Alvaro, let not informality topple over into *familiarity.* We will take the first question now. Francis?"

"Thank you, sir. Lord Alvaro, what we just heard on the topic of Ajax's strategy was pretty chilling. In your opinion, as someone who knew him, how serious is he with his stance on non-humans in Orden? And how should we reconcile this with the treaties he signed with the elves and dwarves of Vasloria? Thank you for your time, my lord."

"Ah, yes," Alvaro said, eyebrows raised theatrically. "Jack's famous 'pro-human' rhetoric." And there was a susurration among the students. For the last hour, Lord Alvaro had only referred to the subject of his lecture as "Ajax." Everyone in the city knew Ajax and Alvaro attended university together, but for the first time, the students in the lecture hall understood-they had been *friends*.

"The short answer is: no. I don't believe Jack is a raving ah... 'human supremacist,' as the broadsheets put it. That's Mortum. But he does find the idea *useful*.

"I spoke for the last hour on Jack's *tactics*. But let's talk about his high-level goals for a moment. Remember everything I just said about Vasloria. The unique problems it presents to someone like Jack. Vasloria is probably as complex a problem as Ajax will ever face. No centralized government, no infrastructure. There's no Vaslorian equivalent of the Heliopolis, or Capital, Kashiato, or Qarat al Ya'tib. So how does one *conquer* a region with no unified identity and no central command?

"Well, you *create* that identity. Consider, before the coming of Ajax, most humans in the region only knew the elves and dwarves as a source of trade! Commerce. Large-scale battles were mostly fought between human duchies.

"Ajax systematically *defeats* those dukes, replacing them with... no one, and he forces the elves and dwarves to sign treaties at swordpoint. Like the dwarves of Kal Kalavar. They pay tribute to Ajax in forced labor. They don't send *dwarves*, oh no! They capture *humans*. Those unsuited for labor go into the Body Banks.

"So, what has Jack done? He's chopped the head off the feudal system in Vasloria leaving only far-flung baronies to fend for themselves. The people feel scared, alone. Leaderless. If the people use the roads, they risk capture by the dwarves; if they use the woods for resources, they're cut down by the elves. So they learn to *distrust* the elves and dwarves.

"I think it's a stroke of genius. *Conquering* all of Vasloria by force would be a long and bloody affair. Instead, he creates the conditions that will allow him to *save* Vasloria. He lets this field lie fallow for a few years, and, when he returns, there'll be a whole generation of young people who do not remember a time when the roads or forests were safe. Who *hate* the dwarves and elves. When Ajax returns, they will welcome him as their protector and he will unite them *against* these new enemies.

"It's a long plan, but I can't see any way it won't work. Uniting humans by pitting them against everyone else in Orden is a strategy I think he'll rely on more and more. It's working very well for him. Next question."

"Lord Alvaro, according to the broadsheets, there are many new churches in Vasloria dedicated to 'Saint' Ajax. Do you believe this is part of his grand strategy? Thank you, my lord."

"That's Mortum's doing, I'm sure of it. Mortum was a great believer in the power of religion as a tool to manipulate societies. If Jack's given it any thought at all, he'd see it as a sound strategy for his plan to return as, not just the protector, but the *savior* of the land. I suspect if Mortum hadn't pushed the idea, Jack would have thought of it sooner or later. The Pharoah of Khemhara commands *enormous* power, more than any political leader in all Orden, because uniquely he is both head of state and the chief religious officer. Even the emperors of Caelila didn't think of that. Next question."

"Thank you. Lord Alvaro, *if* Ajax is trying to conquer the world... do you think he will succeed?"

"Yes. Unless there's rapid agreement between all the powers of the world to work together and stop him? Yes, he's going to win. It's precisely because he knew such an alliance of powers was practically impossible that he even considered a Caelian-style campaign of conquest in the first place.

"Next question."

### On Ajax

He bestrides the land like one of history's great conquerors. A combination of ambition, courage, and study created a master tactician in command of a massive army collecting countless priceless treasures-and no one to stand in his way.

#### By Might and Merit

Ajax the Invincible has earned his title. He graduated top of his class at Capital's military academy, and then immediately launched into a campaign across his homeland of Phaedros. At his side was his advisor Mortum, a nefarious wizard who guided Ajax in the footsteps of the Caelian Empire's conquests before them.

Together, Ajax and Mortum went on to subjugate and enlist hamlet after town after city after territory with little standing in their way. When they successfully returned the Chrysopolis-an ancient flying sky-elf city-to the sky, and their accomplishments literally rose above the country-no one could ignore their might any longer.

#### Treasures Abound

Ajax lays claims to many powerful treasures, both gifted to him in exchange for sanctuary and taken by his own hands. The Mantle of the Phoenix Queen, a harness that conjures the wings of a phoenix. Uthgryl, the Negotiator, Blade of the Gol King, a sword so sharp that it could cleave a person's willpower in two. The Hand of Kukai, a gauntlet plated in jade that harbors powerful, forbidden magic.

His arsenal is vast and strategically picked to round out his strength. There are few situations he isn't prepared to handle.

#### The Iron Saint

While some of his forces may refer to Ajax as the Iron Saint, the version of him presented here hasn't taken up that title yet. Ajax the Invincible will continue to amass followers, treasures, and titles until he can ascend to his rightful status as a saint. It's up to the heroes to make sure this will never come to pass.

#### Ajax's Languages

Ajax speaks Caelian, Higaran, Khoursirian, Phaedran, Riojan, Vaniric, and Vaslorian.

<!-- -->
> **Ajax the Leader**
>
> Ajax is a master tactician. It would stand to reason that he can enter battle leading an army instead of facing the heroes solo.
>
> Future adventures might feature different iterations and stat blocks for Ajax. For now, you can convert Ajax the Invincible into a level 11 leader with the following adjustments:
>
> - Reduce his encounter value to EV 52.
> - Reduce his Stamina to 280.
> - Remove his **Ajax Turns** trait.
> - Remove all his maneuvers.
> - Add the following maneuver:
>
> **Strike Them Down** Two allies within 10 squares of Ajax each move up to their speed and can use a signature ability.
>
> - Adjust the **I'm Not Done Yet** trait so that Ajax dies at −140 Stamina instead of −350.

###### Tactical Stance (Ajax Feature)

At the start of each round, Ajax chooses a new stance from one of the following options and gains its benefits:

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Insurgent**
>
> Ajax automatically treats his initial power roll as a 17. He can still roll to determine if he scores a critical hit.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Mastermind**
>
> Before he uses an ability, Ajax can either shift up to 2 squares, or can cause one creature within line of effect to slide up to 2 squares, ignoring stability.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Vanguard**
>
> Ajax has damage immunity 5. Additionally, any enemy who makes a power roll that includes Ajax as a target has a double bane on the roll.

###### Ajax's Malice

At the start of Ajax's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Reason (2 Malice)**
>
> Ajax attempts to instill doubt into a creature within line of effect through logic and reason. The creature and Ajax make an opposed Reason test. If Ajax wins, he chooses to either deal 11 extra damage to one target on his next strike or to gain an additional triggered action during the current round. Ajax can't use this feature against the same creature during the same encounter.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Nexus Jewel (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, Ajax chooses one of the following environments he has previously visited and overlays that environment on top of the encounter map, temporarily merging multiple realities.
>
> **Incredibly High Above the Ground:** The winds whip and bluster. Any creature who can't fly takes a −3 penalty to stability, and forced movement effects gain a +3 bonus to their distance against such creatures.
>
> **Swamp:** The ground is difficult terrain for enemies. Any creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space is restrained (save ends).
>
> **Volcanic Canyon:** The air is stiflingly hot. Each enemy takes 5 fire damage for each square they enter.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> Ajax takes an additional main action on his turn. He can use this feature even if he is dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Draw Steel (10 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Magic, Ranged, Weapon** |                          **Main Action** |
> | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------: |
> | **📏 Four 3 cubes within 10**   | **🎯 Each enemy and object in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** Each target makes a test using their highest characteristic.
>
> - **≤11:** 26 damage; bleeding and slowed (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 22 damage; bleeding (save ends)
> - **17+:** 16 damage
>
> Ajax then raises his Blade of the Gol King above his head as four giant blades emerge from the ground to fill the area. Each target is pushed into an unoccupied space adjacent to the area after the power roll is resolved. Each blade blocks line of effect and can be dismissed by Ajax at will (no action required).

## Angulotls

Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa-LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they're threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.

#### Deadly Toxins

Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression-because they don't need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.

#### Indicator Species

Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn't take much to upset that balance. While toxins don't kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path-even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most-and sometimes grants them strange abilities.

#### Moisture Dependent

Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it's raining.

#### Clawfish

Known as q'ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.

#### Angulotl Languages

Most angulotls speak Filliaric.

#### Wet

Angulotls make use of a unique effect called "wet." While wet, an angulotl doesn't provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.

###### Angulotl Malice

At the start of any angulotl's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Leapfrog (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, when an angulotl moves through an inactive angulotl's space, the inactive angulotl can use a free triggered action to jump 3 squares.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Resonating Croak (5 Malice)**
>
> Each angulotl in the encounter puffs out their throat and starts loudly droning Any non-angulotl adjacent to an angulotl makes an **Intuition test.**
>
> - **≤11:** 5 sonic damage; slowed (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 4 sonic damage
> - **17+:** No effect.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Rainfall (7 Malice)**
>
> An angulotl calls clouds to cover the encounter map and unleash rain until the end of the round. Any creature or object that is exposed to the sky is wet until the end of the encounter.

###### On Angulotls

> They like humans! Adults tend to freak them out a little. I don't think they realize tall humans are the same species as tiny humans!

###### Angulotl Tactics

<!-- -->
> **Angulotl Tactics**
>
> Angulotls are not generally aggressive, and if confronted, a patrol of frog folk will usually exchange a few blows before performing a harrying retreat to their hidden villages. In defense of their homes, however, they become much fiercer and more determined. In these battles, angulotls try to force fights in or near water to take advantage of their amphibious nature and the wet effect.
>
> Simple patrols are usually made up of slippery captains leaping into the backline and harassing low-Stamina heroes while their minion hordes keep higher-Stamina heroes engaged. In larger engagements their tactics become more defensive to protect their high-value units. They tend to stay in close and coherent groups to take advantage of support abilities.

## Animals

The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal-to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to *become* monsters. A hero wouldn't mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves-but they'll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.

### Animal Traits

This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal's most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block's EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.

<!-- -->
> **Lots of Options!**
>
> When using animal traits, think about using one mobility trait and either a defensive or an offensive trait to capture the sense of the animal. Other animal traits that don't need to be on the stat block can emerge naturally through gameplay, such as a cat taking no damage from a fall.

#### Animal Stat Blocks

The following stat blocks can be used to describe everyday animals capable of acting as threats or challenges to the heroes under appropriate circumstances. Alternatively, you can add traits to these stat blocks to describe animals of a specific type. If you're adding traits to animal stat blocks, build out your custom animals ahead of time to lessen the amount of flipping back and forth between stat blocks and traits during play.

#### Animal Notation

When building an animal by adding traits to a stat block, you can use a shorthand to describe the animal. For example, a dire wolf might be denoted as "Predator B: Swiftness, Pack, Hunter" to indicate that you're using the Predator B stat block with the Swiftness, Pack, and Hunter traits.

The Example Animals table breaks out a number of animals using this notation. Selected traits are listed in order by category-mobility, defensive, offensive, and supernatural.

<!-- -->
> **Can I Make a Harmless Animal?**
>
> You certainly can! Animal traits can be applied to the **noncombatant** stat block to make unimposing animals the heroes can rescue (see Harmless Creatures in the Introduction section). Surviving a wild animal attack can also be handled through group tests and montage tests as if those animals were environmental challenges to overcome rather than individual threats.

## Arixx

Pebbles dance as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon's peace, and an arixx blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.

An arixx is a chitinous burrowing insectoid beast who stands taller than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.

#### Pastoral Pest

Although arixxi can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. An arixx hunts alone, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make the arixx virtually impossible to eradicate-unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain arixx.

#### Terror of the Thaw

Arixxi are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, arixxi hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace. But this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every arixx awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.

###### Arixx Malice

A creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space on the ground and can't burrow sinks 1 square into the ground.

## Ashen Hoarder

Grave robbing is a dangerous business, but necromancers need bodies for their experiments. To procure supplies and stay out of danger, these mages build ashen hoarders-hulking constructs made of magically reinforced humanoid bones.

### Appendages and Spikes

Ashen hoarders sport four long legs made from compact columns of bone, allowing them to move quickly and avoid creatures who might try to hinder the construct's grim work. Powerful clawed arms aid the hoarder in digging up corpses and fighting enemies.

When an ashen hoarder obtains corpses, they impale them on the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with corruptive energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer's door.

### Weaponized Bodies

These automatons are equipped to protect their cargo. If enemies corner an ashen hoarder, the construct can use the energy stored within their corpses to reanimate them as deadly mines, detonating the remains with explosive corruptive energy. Once the threat is dead, the ashen hoarder can retrieve the enemies' remains and recollect the pieces of their original load.

### Soul Shackle

Creating and powering an ashen hoarder requires a vast amount of necromantic energy. Along with an entire ossuary worth of bones to construct its body, powering the construct requires a soul. That soul is divided between the hoarder and an object known as a Soul Shackle usually a ring or an amulet-that is used to command the construct. Destroying the Soul Shackle can free the trapped soul, but doing so sends an ashen hoarder into an indiscriminate unshackled rage as they feel part of their stolen soul shredded into oblivion. The construct lashes out against any living creature they can before collapsing in on themself. Freeing the soul still trapped inside the ashen hoarder's remains requires completing the Find a Cure downtime project in *[Draw Steel: Heroes](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Heroes)* and the assistance of a powerful holy figure.

## Basilisks

With eight legs, a scaled rough hide, and razor-sharp teeth coated in poison, the basilisk is a deadly threat-even aside from their petrifying eye beams. This dreadful creature can fell the mightiest of foes with a look, turning them into an immobilized stone statue who remains thankfully unaware when the basilisk later consumes their petrified form at their leisure.

### Raising Young

Basilisks typically live in mated pairs and raise small clutches of younglings from the comforts of damp caves. Adults prefer to subsist on berries, fish, fowl, and carrion, resorting to eating their petrified victims only when starving. By contrast, basilisk younglings can eat only petrified victims, and basilisks have been known to travel far from their nest to populated areas in search of prey for their babies.

### Dangerous Servitors

Crime lords and overminds seek basilisk eggs to hatch, raising and training basilisks as bodyguards and pets. Training is dangerous, and many handlers (and their unscrupulous colleagues) find themselves turned to stone when a basilisk escapes and runs amok.

Some creatures keep basilisks not for their terrifying abilities, but for their immunity to petrification. Medusas commonly keep basilisks as pets, owing to their own limited options for companionship. Both parties benefit from this relationship, as the medusa feeds their own victims to the basilisk and their younglings.

### Alchemical Properties

Alchemists have discovered a gland in the basilisk's mouth that excretes an oil that reverts stone to flesh, making it easier to digest prey. If enough of the oil is collected, a salve can be created to restore a petrified victim. Unsavory alchemists pay good money to those willing to steal a basilisk youngling from their nest.

<!-- -->

## Bredbeddle

In their true forms, bredbeddles are ogre-sized headless giants. Forever searching for their missing heads, they are drawn to populous lands, where they decapitate passers-by and magically adopt their victims' forms.

Although bredbeddles have no traditional sensory organs of their own, they are keenly aware of their surroundings. Some lurk along dark country lanes in their monstrous true forms. Others walk disguised among crowds, dropping their facade only long enough to waylay a stranger and lop off their head.

### Immortal Wanderers

Bredbeddles don't age, and if they are slain, their bodies reform a few days later. Long ago, bredbeddles were giants who stood high among the nobility of giant kind. But when they declared themselves rulers of all giant kind, their kin thwarted the coup and beheaded the bredbeddles. Now these fallen nobles search the world for their missing heads, each wielding the axe that decapitated them. Tales tell of how their heads are kept for safekeeping in a fire giant's cellar to be returned after an indeterminate period of good behavior, which no bredbeddle has exhibited thus far.

### Green with Frenzy

The longer a bredbeddle goes without a head, the more twisted and desperate their power grows. Their desire to be whole stretches out of their body in the form of shadowy dark-green ribbons, wrapping around and clinging to every surface they spill onto.

Travelers warn one another of roads rumored to be haunted by "wild green knights," often avoiding these routes for months. No journey is worth losing your head over.

### Bredbeddle Languages

When a bredbeddle communicates, they typically use High Kuric or the languages that their head's previous owner knew. A bredbeddle who has taken multiple heads over their lifetime most likely knows Caelian as well.

###### Bredbeddle Malice

At the start of a bredbeddle's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Engreen (3 Malice)**
>
> The bredbeddle's axe lengthens and turns a ghastly green, granting a +1 bonus to the distance of the bredbeddle's melee strikes and the dimensions of their burst area abilities until the end of their turn.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Shadow Stockade (5 Malice)**
>
> A ghostly size 1L stockade seeps out from under the bredbeddle's feet to fill an unoccupied square within 10 squares. When a size 1L or smaller enemy enters the stockade's square, they are restrained (save ends). When a restrained creature is no longer restrained, the stockade fades away. At the start of each of the bredbeddle's turns, they can slide an active stockade and any creature in it up to 5 squares.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The bredbeddle takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Green Phantom 7 Malice**
>
> A phantom second bredbeddle phases into view, appearing in an unoccupied space anywhere on the encounter map, then vanishing at the end of the round. The phantom bredbeddle shares the original bredbeddle's statistics but has 24 Stamina, corruption immunity 10, and can fly. The phantom bredbeddle can take one turn and use any of the bredbeddle's abilities except for villain actions. Only one phantom bredbeddle can be active at a time.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Monster**
>
> **End Effect:** At the end of each of their turns, the bredbeddle can take 5 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.
>
> **Solo Turns:** The bredbeddle can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Heady or Not**
>
> While headless, the bredbeddle can move into a space containing a severed head and attach it to their neck as a main action. Doing so physically transforms the bredbeddle, who takes on the appearance, size, weight, and stability of the head's original owner. If the bredbeddle takes the form of a creature of size 1L or smaller, the distance of their melee and burst area abilities decreases by 1. These effects last until the bredbeddle is killed or beheaded, or until the head falls off after 24 hours. A head that falls off this way can no longer be attached to this bredbeddle.
>
> A creature must succeed on a **hard Might test** made as a maneuver to rip a head off the bredbeddle. If they fail, the bredbeddle can make a free strike against them.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Resilient Form**
>
> The bredbeddle can't be physically transformed in any way except by their Heady or Not trait.

> **Effect:** A beheaded target has their head fall into an unoccupied square adjacent to the bredbeddle, but they remain alive. While beheaded this way, the target is bleeding and has line of effect only to adjacent squares. The beheaded target can survive without their head for 24 hours, and can reattach their head as a maneuver by entering its square. A target who remains beheaded for 24 hours dies.

## Bugbears

Bugbears are the bu'gath in the Khelt language, or "the bearers of the great fear." Modern bugbears come from early goblins who first stepped into the wode centuries ago. Fey magic twisted their bodies, making them grow imposingly tall and hairy while removing all sound from their footsteps.

Many bugbears become legendary hunters and mercenaries. Many more become reclusive and hide their whole lives in the shadows. A rare few dive into their magic potential and become living nightmares who haunt the wode.

### Thrown Into the Fray

Bugbears seldom seek the settlements of others for trade or allyship, and are known to tenaciously defend their own homes or their neighbors' homes. This has given them a reputation of being covert, insurgent warriors, when in reality, bugbears simply fight to maintain their quiet solitude.

When bugbears are compelled to take action, they take to the high ground and use their powerful arms to throw anything they can down at the problem. This includes daggers, heavy iron balls, each other, and sometimes throwing the enemy at the enemy.

### Goblin Bond

Bugbears value their shared origin with goblins and hobgoblins despite the three lines branching apart so dramatically. They think of themselves as goblinoids first and humanoids second, with that relationship providing a sense of common ground when cloistered bugbears come out of isolation.

###### Bugbear Malice

At the start of any bugbear's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Goblin Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The bugbear activates a Malice Feature available to goblins.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Grab Iron Ball (3+ Malice)**
>
> For every 3 Malice spent, one non-minion bugbear acting this turn grabs an iron ball and can use a maneuver to throw it at a creature within 5 squares of them. The creature takes damage equal to 8 - the number of squares the iron ball was thrown, and if they have M < 1, they are slowed (save ends).

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Grab Javelin (5+ Malice)**
>
> For every 5 Malice spent, one non-minion bugbear acting this turn grabs a javelin and can use a maneuver to throw it at a creature within 5 squares of them. The creature takes damage equal to 12 - the number of squares the javelin was thrown, and if they have M < 1, they are bleeding (save ends). While a creature is bleeding this way, any ally of the bugbear within 2 squares of them can use a free maneuver to pull the bleeding creature up to 2 squares.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Show Them the Great Fear (10 Malice)**
>
> A bugbear infuses the encounter map with bu'gathic magic. Until the end of the encounter, all bugbears and allies have their speed doubled and can automatically climb at full speed while moving. Additionally, if the target of any bugbear or ally's strike has I < 1, the target is also frightened (save ends) and must move their speed in a straight line away from the creature who made the strike.

### Bu'gathic Magic

Most bugbears have some control over their inherent magic, enabling them to perform a trick or two. Dedicated bugbear channelers have learned to evoke powerful shadow and rot magic. These mages can reshape the appearance of the world around them and temporarily alter their foes as defensive tactics, providing ample warning to enemies that they are capable of far worse if those enemies push onward. Bu'gathic magic also enables bugbears to hide their settlements behind shadowy veils within canyons and impenetrable swamplands.

### Bugbear Languages

Most bugbears speak Caelian, Khelt, and Szetch.

## Chimera

Massive flexing claws. Lashing draconic tail. Nimble leathery wings. And not one, but three menacing heads: a snarling lion, a helix-horned ram, and a dragon with fire sparking in their throat. Many see the chimera as an aggressor-but few know this creature's origins as a divine guardian.

### The First Chimera

The first chimera was a gift. A deity gave a devout queen this young guardian-one with a dragon's cunning, a lion's bravery, and a ram's tenacity. The queen raised the chimera to be a strong protector not just for herself but also her people, who loved the chimera and their ruler. But neighboring lands feared the beast. As a conquering force swept into the land, slaughtering the chimera was their fell goal.

The queen's resulting fury was said to be felt by the gods. As she screamed, a nearby volcano erupted, spewing basalt and chimeras over the land. With fiery might, the chimeras destroyed the opposing army, then dispersed. Each found a new territory and claimed the role of divine protector over that place, its inhabitants, and its treasures.

### Tactical Warriors

Chimeras have many ways to keep themselves and their charges from being cornered. The lion head snaps up enemies in massive jaws and hurls them away, the ram head pummels them to the ground, and the dragon head bathes them in fire. The three heads crying out together can shake even the most stalwart warriors.

### One Being, Three Heads

Unlike some other multiheaded creatures, a chimera possesses a single unified mind. Their heads work together, never snapping at one another over food, favors, or personality conflicts. The heads often express the chimera's emotions in unison, braying together in times of battle or purring all at once to show affection.

###### Chimera Malice

At the start of a chimera's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Defensive Snapping (3 Malice)**
>
> The chimera takes up a defensive stance. Until the start of their next turn, the chimera can make a free strike against each enemy who comes within 2 squares of them.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The chimera takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Unstable Terrain (5 Malice)**
>
> The chimera shakes the ground, causing an eruption of loose rocks and debris that creates three size 2 stone objects anywhere on the encounter map. Each creature adjacent to one or more objects when they appear who has A < 2 takes 5 damage.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Ashen Clouds (7 Malice)**
>
> Until the start of the chimera's next turn, all areas of the encounter map are shrouded in a thick cloud of ash. All creatures and objects on the map have concealment that the chimera ignores. Additionally, each enemy in the cloud who has I < 1 has line of effect only within 3 squares. The potency of this feature increases by 1 each time it's used.

## Demons

Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun.

The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.

### Mortal Alliances

Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.

### Soul Reavers

Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.

### Lethe

When a demon's soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe-a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.

### Demonic Hierarchy

Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don't use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service.

Each time a demon consumes a soul, there's a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt-or heroic.

### Demon Languages

Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.

### Demons-1st Echelon

A number of lesser demons have been identified across categories 1 to 3.

**Pitlings** resemble rodents or insects with gleaming green eyes and terrible body odor, and disgorge a viscous, toxic phlegm.

**Ensnarers** are the result of pitlings getting hold of an unfortunate soul. A pitling in the process of digesting the soul of a creature has that soul physically bore through their head to become a fanged appendage. Mouths form across the creature's body, each attacking with long, barbed tongues.

**Frenzieds** are similar to ensnarers, but their transformation into a true demon is more advanced. This results in a fast and vicious creature full of energy and hungry for more souls.

**Bendraks** (BEN-drax) appear as an amalgamation of flesh and the shards of broken mirrors, which they use to distract and confuse their foes. A bendrak can divert an enemy's attack to another enemy, and can hide themselves or allies behind dazzling reflections.

**Mucerons** (MIU-sur-onz) are the result of an ensnarer going through repeated demon evolutions to become a brutish creature. They are covered in multiple mouths that shoot out barbed tongues, tearing at enemies as they are dragged out of position.

**Remasches** (REE-mash-iz) have physical forms blended with the nature of the wastes where they dwell. A remasch teleports around the battlefield, inflicting chaos on their enemies directly or through the minions they control. These demons are rumored to be the initial source of the teachings of all shadows through the College of Black Ash.

**Ruinants** (rew-in-ANSE) are possessed of glowing eyes and tendrilringed maws, their bodies covered in inflamed scars and their breath coming as a sickening wheeze. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the demon's own body.

**Torlases** (TORR-lahs-iz) are piecemeal abominations whose physical forms don't obey the mundane laws of geometry. They control the battlefield by using living flesh and whipping allies and enemies alike into advantageous position.

**Chorogaunts** (cor-roh-GAWNTS) are terrifying demon leaders. Each is an amalgamation of several demon bodies formed into a mobile musical instrument. Several heads are arranged into a chorus embedded in the demon's chest, and their ribs are upturned into a fleshy pipe organ. Their attacks entrance and confuse enemies, making them more vulnerable to other demons.

###### Demon Malice (Level 1+ Malice Features)

At the start of any demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Soulburn (3 Malice)**
>
> Each demon acting this turn has a double edge on abilities.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Abyssal Evolution (7 Malice)**
>
> A demon minion of your choice transforms into a non-minion horde demon of the same level.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Abyssal Rift (7 Malice)**
>
> Two size 2 rifts to the Abyssal Wasteland appear at locations of your choice. Any demon can use an abyssal rift as a portal to another abyssal rift in the encounter, moving into any space in one rift and appearing immediately in any unoccupied space in the other rift. A non-demon who enters a rift for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes corruption damage equal to the level of the highest-level demon on the encounter map. An abyssal rift is an immovable object that has 25 Stamina, damage immunity 2, and holy weakness 5. The rift closes when there are no demons remaining on the encounter map. Additionally, a creature who has the Magic or Psionics skill can make a Reason test or Intuition test as a maneuver while adjacent to a rift to destabilize and close it.
>
> - **≤11:** The rift remains open and regains 5 Stamina.
> - **12-16:** The rift remains open.
> - **17+:** The rift closes.

### Demons-2nd Echelon

As demons consume more souls and their mercurial forms shift into more powerful ones, they begin to evolve more distinct personalities, desires, and intelligence-often based on the souls consumed. Across categories 4 to 6, demons develop a particular taste for certain types of souls, which eventually come to define them should they survive long enough.

**Grulqins** (GRUHL-kinz) consist of a bulbous head, two powerful arms, and a circular serrated blade of bone that runs down the middle of their head.

**Orliq** (or-LEEK) are made of shifting bone plates surrounding a swirling core of corruptive energy.

**Wobalas** (WOH-buh-luss) prefer to kill from afar while protected by allies, firing psychic bolts from bows shaped of their own flesh and sinew.

**Bale eyes**, sometimes called "flesh moons," are colossal floating orbs of roiling, dripping flesh. A weeping seam in that flesh opens to reveal a demonic eye whose gaze turns creatures' mental and physical faculties upside down.

**Fanglings** have bodies overgrown with teeth, fangs, and tusks from countless creatures. They are deadly in close quarters, to attackers and bystanders alike.

**Fiktin** (FIK-ten) are cunning hunters who disguise themselves as mundane objects, leaving a foul-smelling oily red residue wherever they have been. Their true form is a humanoid shape made of red oil.

**Gunge** (GUHNJ) demons are horrifically distended, with maws that can swallow a horse whole. A gunge vomits up bilious slime that traps and dissolves any creature unlucky enough to get caught in it.

**Tourmenauks** (tor-min-AUX) resemble a hulking ape with a dozen or more extra mouths distributed around their body. Though their brute force is formidable, this demon also inflicts raw psychic pain by wailing from their mouths in different voices-often the agonized voices of souls the tormenauk has devoured.

**Lumbering egresses** are mobile masses of warped flesh set around an enormous whirling portal to the demonic realms. Lesser demons pour out through these portals at alarming rates, letting these creatures act as devastating siege engines.

###### Demon Malice (Level 4+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 4 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level or lower.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Abyssal Jaunt (3 Malice)**
>
> One demon acting this turn folds space around them, temporarily slipping in and out of the Abyssal Wasteland. Until the start of the demon's next turn, they ignore difficult terrain, can move through solid matter, and don't provoke opportunity attacks by moving. If the demon ends their turn inside solid matter, they are shunted out into the space from which they entered it.

### Demons-3rd Echelon

Demons of categories 7 to 9 continue to mutate in new and unpredictable ways, or are sometimes corrupted and spawned from other powerful creatures to become part of the demonic hierarchy. Additionally, in a plane of chaos, the soulraker demon is notable for fashioning a facsimile of order within themself. These demonic wasps make up a single, chaotic hive mind. They serve a demonic hivequeen, who relies on cannibalizing her children to ingest any souls they've consumed.

**Soulraker scouts** are the vile progeny of a soulraker hivequeen demonic wasps who emerge from her distended abdomen with an earsplitting buzz.

**Soulraker soldiers** are demonic wasps armored in dense chitin who favor driving foes before them.

**Soulraker stingers** are wasps covered in poisonous barbed stingers that they launch like quills, their wings atrophied and unusable.

**Blight phages** were once angelic creatures. Corrupted by demonic forces, each is now a cruel, distended mockery of a cherubic form, covered in pestilent boils that seep ruinous blight.

**Chimerons** (kai-MEHR-ons) are a horrifying amalgam of multiple demonic forms melded into a unique monstrosity, driven by an unslakable hunger for souls.

**Styrichs** (STEE-rix) feature lanky bodies covered with manes of long, razor-sharp hair, which they whip around the battlefield to shred their enemies.

**Soulraker handmaidens** are abyssal parasites implanted in victims by a soulraker hivequeen. Handmaidens gestate inside a host until they're ready to emerge from the body, then consume souls until they're strong enough to transform into a new hivequeen.

**Soulraker praetorians** are the elite guards of a hivequeen, dripping foul-smelling ichor and using their barbed stingers to lay waste to foes.

A **soulraker hivequeen** is a demonic wasp whose abdomen houses their own soulraker wasp hive, and whose stinging ovipositor implants victims with handmaiden parasites.

###### Demon Malice (Level 7+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 7 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level 6 or lower.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Seeping Blight (5 Malice)**

### Demons-4th Echelon

The more souls a demon consumes, the more they evolve. The more they evolve, the more refined their tastes become, until eventually demons of category 10 can be satisfied only by consuming souls that exemplify particular qualities. Many demons of this category have their tastes honored by their titles, such as Gorgino, the Sensuous Feast; Tyx, the Obliviated Spiral; and Lorikta, the Discarded Dream.

**Optacus** (OHP-tih-cus) demons are abyssal eyes atop a spindly flesh stalk supported by innumerable legs. Able to affix to any surface, they shoot deadly beams of fire at distant foes.

**Tyburakis** (tee-berr-AH-kees) appear as a horrifying cross between a thresher shark and a terror lizard, their tails lined with tiny shark maws that allow them to bite multiple foes at once.

**Unguloids** (UHN-jyl-oids) have a centaur-like form, with a body and head resembling a demonic rhinoceros. They are known for their devastating charge.

**Izyaks** (ee-zi-YAHKS) have a mercurial form that ripples with psionic energy, making these demons appear different to all those who observe them. Their true form is a brain supported on four bone legs.

**Vicisitators** (vih-SIS-ih-tay-tors) are dangerous and horrifically unstable, the flesh and bone of their bodies trapped in a state of perpetual agonizing flux. Their very touch results in excruciating pain as it warps flesh, bone, and soul.

**Aurumvas** (or-UM-vahs) the demon king stands alone among named demons for craving not only wealth, but highly avaricious souls. A towering figure with a stack of crowns atop his ophidian head, he is a vision of opulence, excess, and absolute debasement. He lords over other powerful demons by virtue of the wealth held in his vast vaults in the Abyssal Wasteland, acquired through the slaughter of countless creatures. But even as he gazes upon his riches and supernatural treasures, Aurumvas wants for more. He draws lesser demons and wicked mortals to his service with the promise of minor treasures, knowing full well that one needs to spend wealth to make it. If left unchecked, Aurumvas's servile armies and glittering hoards might one day encompass the entire timescape.

## Devils

In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly for power and control-a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes. Devils are distinguished from other humanoids by skin in shades of azure and crimson, as well as their hellmarks: horns, tails, hooves, wings, and other infernal features.

### Precarious Pyramids

The Seven Cities of Hell stand atop strict hierarchy and bureaucracy. Primordial chains of command place each devil in service to a more powerful devil, with the seven archdevil rulers of Hell at the top. While devils are lawful, they're always looking for another way up the ladder. They twist every rule to their benefit to gain power and usurp those they answer to, eager to uncover loopholes in the eternal struggle for significance and supremacy.

### Silver Tongues

Winsome devils can acquire significant influence by bargaining for the souls of mortals on behalf of the archdevil they ultimately serve. Virtuosos with words, devils are skilled at striking deals and forging contracts. They exploit the weaknesses of mortals, whether greed, revenge, vanity, or simple desperation. In the heat of battle, a devil's supernatural charisma can influence a mortal to do their bidding, often without realizing until it's too late.

<!-- -->
> **Negotiations with Devils**
>
> Devils are eager to negotiate and strike deals, but often require more compelling arguments and concrete evidence from the other party. You can pick from the following motivations and pitfalls to quickly create a devil from one of the Seven Cities for a negotiation (see Chapter 11 in *Draw Steel: Heroes*):
>
> - **Motivation:** Greed, Power, Legacy
> - **Pitfall:** Benevolence, Freedom, Protection
>
> During a negotiation, an NPC devil has their impression and patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Their interest goes up to 10 instead of 5.
>
> When an NPC devil is ready to make an offer, divide their interest by 2 to get their final response. A devil typically never settles a negotiation unless they're promised something desirable in return.

### True Names

All devils have two names: one by which they're commonly known, and another secret true name. Each devil zealously safeguards the latter, as their true name can be spoken aloud to aid in summoning them-or in stripping them of their power.

### Hell's Defectors

Not every devil in the Seven Cities wants to ruthlessly ascend the hierarchy. Some desire advancement, but they remain dissatisfied at the bottom. As luck would have it, these fiends can free themselves from Hell's bureaucracy, for when a mortal overestimates their fortitude and dies while enacting an infernal summoning, it can leave an enterprising devil stranded in the mundane world.

### Devil Languages

Most devils speak Anjal and Caelian, among other languages. The more powerful a devil, the more languages they learn in order to more easily make ironclad contracts with a wide variety of people and cultures. Outside of rare circumstances, devils are always willing to negotiate, ever desiring to twist a situation in their favor.

###### Devil Malice

At the start of any devil's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Bureaucratic Tape (3 Malice)**
>
> One devil acting this turn uses a signature ability against an adjacent creature. On a tier 3 outcome, the target of the ability has a double bane on strikes (save ends).

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Underhanded Tactics (5+ Malice)**
>
> One or two devils can teleport to a space adjacent to one or more creatures who aren't hidden and make a free strike. For each 2 additional Malice spent on this feature, one additional devil can teleport.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Read the Small Print (7 Malice)**
>
> Each enemy in the encounter is subject to a bad deal proposed by the devils. An enemy must choose between having damage weakness 5 or taking a bane on power rolls. The bad deal lasts until the end of the encounter.

<!-- -->
> **Devil Temptations**
>
> Although some devils enjoy comfort and opulence for their own sake, they primarily use treasure as bargaining chips in fiendish compacts: bait on the devils' infernal barbs.
>
> Even more sinister than a prize won in a devil's hard bargain is a gift freely given by a devil. The advantages of such a gift are conditional, lasting only until the devil revokes it at some inconvenient time.
>
> The following are samples of the wonders that a devil can offer-to only the most discriminating customers, of course. A devil might only have two or three of these items available for trade, but others (such as an archdevil's wing) can be won by force. See *Draw Steel: Heroes* for more information about how these items can be used by heroes.
>
> **Components:** An archdevil's wing, archdevil's blood, soul chalk, a wide selection of true names
>
> **Project Sources:** Notes in Anjali for the Devil's Bargain armor enhancement or a Hellcharger Helm, notes in Hyrallic for a Mediator's Charm
>
> **Titles:** Diabolist, Maestro
>
> **Treasures:** G'Allios Visiting Card, Thief of Joy
>
> **Wealth:** Each hero can earn 1 wealth in exchange for a small favor
