## Ajax the Invincible

"On behalf of the college, I would like to thank Lord Alvaro for his excellent lecture. The whole school owes you a debt for donating your time today. We will now open the floor to questions. Before we do, I would like to remind you that we enjoy a certain amount of informality here at the war college, but when speaking to Lord Alvaro, let not informality topple over into *familiarity.* We will take the first question now. Francis?"

"Thank you, sir. Lord Alvaro, what we just heard on the topic of Ajax's strategy was pretty chilling. In your opinion, as someone who knew him, how serious is he with his stance on non-humans in Orden? And how should we reconcile this with the treaties he signed with the elves and dwarves of Vasloria? Thank you for your time, my lord."

"Ah, yes," Alvaro said, eyebrows raised theatrically. "Jack's famous 'pro-human' rhetoric." And there was a susurration among the students. For the last hour, Lord Alvaro had only referred to the subject of his lecture as "Ajax." Everyone in the city knew Ajax and Alvaro attended university together, but for the first time, the students in the lecture hall understood-they had been *friends*.

"The short answer is: no. I don't believe Jack is a raving ah... 'human supremacist,' as the broadsheets put it. That's Mortum. But he does find the idea *useful*.

"I spoke for the last hour on Jack's *tactics*. But let's talk about his high-level goals for a moment. Remember everything I just said about Vasloria. The unique problems it presents to someone like Jack. Vasloria is probably as complex a problem as Ajax will ever face. No centralized government, no infrastructure. There's no Vaslorian equivalent of the Heliopolis, or Capital, Kashiato, or Qarat al Ya'tib. So how does one *conquer* a region with no unified identity and no central command?

"Well, you *create* that identity. Consider, before the coming of Ajax, most humans in the region only knew the elves and dwarves as a source of trade! Commerce. Large-scale battles were mostly fought between human duchies.

"Ajax systematically *defeats* those dukes, replacing them with... no one, and he forces the elves and dwarves to sign treaties at swordpoint. Like the dwarves of Kal Kalavar. They pay tribute to Ajax in forced labor. They don't send *dwarves*, oh no! They capture *humans*. Those unsuited for labor go into the Body Banks.

"So, what has Jack done? He's chopped the head off the feudal system in Vasloria leaving only far-flung baronies to fend for themselves. The people feel scared, alone. Leaderless. If the people use the roads, they risk capture by the dwarves; if they use the woods for resources, they're cut down by the elves. So they learn to *distrust* the elves and dwarves.

"I think it's a stroke of genius. *Conquering* all of Vasloria by force would be a long and bloody affair. Instead, he creates the conditions that will allow him to *save* Vasloria. He lets this field lie fallow for a few years, and, when he returns, there'll be a whole generation of young people who do not remember a time when the roads or forests were safe. Who *hate* the dwarves and elves. When Ajax returns, they will welcome him as their protector and he will unite them *against* these new enemies.

"It's a long plan, but I can't see any way it won't work. Uniting humans by pitting them against everyone else in Orden is a strategy I think he'll rely on more and more. It's working very well for him. Next question."

"Lord Alvaro, according to the broadsheets, there are many new churches in Vasloria dedicated to 'Saint' Ajax. Do you believe this is part of his grand strategy? Thank you, my lord."

"That's Mortum's doing, I'm sure of it. Mortum was a great believer in the power of religion as a tool to manipulate societies. If Jack's given it any thought at all, he'd see it as a sound strategy for his plan to return as, not just the protector, but the *savior* of the land. I suspect if Mortum hadn't pushed the idea, Jack would have thought of it sooner or later. The Pharoah of Khemhara commands *enormous* power, more than any political leader in all Orden, because uniquely he is both head of state and the chief religious officer. Even the emperors of Caelila didn't think of that. Next question."

"Thank you. Lord Alvaro, *if* Ajax is trying to conquer the world... do you think he will succeed?"

"Yes. Unless there's rapid agreement between all the powers of the world to work together and stop him? Yes, he's going to win. It's precisely because he knew such an alliance of powers was practically impossible that he even considered a Caelian-style campaign of conquest in the first place.

"Next question."

### On Ajax

He bestrides the land like one of history's great conquerors. A combination of ambition, courage, and study created a master tactician in command of a massive army collecting countless priceless treasures-and no one to stand in his way.

#### By Might and Merit

Ajax the Invincible has earned his title. He graduated top of his class at Capital's military academy, and then immediately launched into a campaign across his homeland of Phaedros. At his side was his advisor Mortum, a nefarious wizard who guided Ajax in the footsteps of the Caelian Empire's conquests before them.

Together, Ajax and Mortum went on to subjugate and enlist hamlet after town after city after territory with little standing in their way. When they successfully returned the Chrysopolis-an ancient flying sky-elf city-to the sky, and their accomplishments literally rose above the country-no one could ignore their might any longer.

#### Treasures Abound

Ajax lays claims to many powerful treasures, both gifted to him in exchange for sanctuary and taken by his own hands. The Mantle of the Phoenix Queen, a harness that conjures the wings of a phoenix. Uthgryl, the Negotiator, Blade of the Gol King, a sword so sharp that it could cleave a person's willpower in two. The Hand of Kukai, a gauntlet plated in jade that harbors powerful, forbidden magic.

His arsenal is vast and strategically picked to round out his strength. There are few situations he isn't prepared to handle.

#### The Iron Saint

While some of his forces may refer to Ajax as the Iron Saint, the version of him presented here hasn't taken up that title yet. Ajax the Invincible will continue to amass followers, treasures, and titles until he can ascend to his rightful status as a saint. It's up to the heroes to make sure this will never come to pass.

#### Ajax's Languages

Ajax speaks Caelian, Higaran, Khoursirian, Phaedran, Riojan, Vaniric, and Vaslorian.

<!-- -->
> **Ajax the Leader**
>
> Ajax is a master tactician. It would stand to reason that he can enter battle leading an army instead of facing the heroes solo.
>
> Future adventures might feature different iterations and stat blocks for Ajax. For now, you can convert Ajax the Invincible into a level 11 leader with the following adjustments:
>
> - Reduce his encounter value to EV 52.
> - Reduce his Stamina to 280.
> - Remove his **Ajax Turns** trait.
> - Remove all his maneuvers.
> - Add the following maneuver:
>
> **Strike Them Down** Two allies within 10 squares of Ajax each move up to their speed and can use a signature ability.
>
> - Adjust the **I'm Not Done Yet** trait so that Ajax dies at −140 Stamina instead of −350.

###### Tactical Stance (Ajax Feature)

At the start of each round, Ajax chooses a new stance from one of the following options and gains its benefits:

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Insurgent**
>
> Ajax automatically treats his initial power roll as a 17. He can still roll to determine if he scores a critical hit.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Mastermind**
>
> Before he uses an ability, Ajax can either shift up to 2 squares, or can cause one creature within line of effect to slide up to 2 squares, ignoring stability.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Vanguard**
>
> Ajax has damage immunity 5. Additionally, any enemy who makes a power roll that includes Ajax as a target has a double bane on the roll.

###### Ajax's Malice

At the start of Ajax's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Reason (2 Malice)**
>
> Ajax attempts to instill doubt into a creature within line of effect through logic and reason. The creature and Ajax make an opposed Reason test. If Ajax wins, he chooses to either deal 11 extra damage to one target on his next strike or to gain an additional triggered action during the current round. Ajax can't use this feature against the same creature during the same encounter.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Nexus Jewel (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, Ajax chooses one of the following environments he has previously visited and overlays that environment on top of the encounter map, temporarily merging multiple realities.
>
> **Incredibly High Above the Ground:** The winds whip and bluster. Any creature who can't fly takes a −3 penalty to stability, and forced movement effects gain a +3 bonus to their distance against such creatures.
>
> **Swamp:** The ground is difficult terrain for enemies. Any creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space is restrained (save ends).
>
> **Volcanic Canyon:** The air is stiflingly hot. Each enemy takes 5 fire damage for each square they enter.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> Ajax takes an additional main action on his turn. He can use this feature even if he is dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Draw Steel (10 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Magic, Ranged, Weapon** |                          **Main Action** |
> | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------: |
> | **📏 Four 3 cubes within 10**   | **🎯 Each enemy and object in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** Each target makes a test using their highest characteristic.
>
> - **≤11:** 26 damage; bleeding and slowed (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 22 damage; bleeding (save ends)
> - **17+:** 16 damage
>
> Ajax then raises his Blade of the Gol King above his head as four giant blades emerge from the ground to fill the area. Each target is pushed into an unoccupied space adjacent to the area after the power roll is resolved. Each blade blocks line of effect and can be dismissed by Ajax at will (no action required).

## Angulotls

Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa-LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they're threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.

#### Deadly Toxins

Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression-because they don't need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.

#### Indicator Species

Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn't take much to upset that balance. While toxins don't kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path-even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most-and sometimes grants them strange abilities.

#### Moisture Dependent

Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it's raining.

#### Clawfish

Known as q'ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.

#### Angulotl Languages

Most angulotls speak Filliaric.

#### Wet

Angulotls make use of a unique effect called "wet." While wet, an angulotl doesn't provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.

###### Angulotl Malice

At the start of any angulotl's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Leapfrog (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, when an angulotl moves through an inactive angulotl's space, the inactive angulotl can use a free triggered action to jump 3 squares.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Resonating Croak (5 Malice)**
>
> Each angulotl in the encounter puffs out their throat and starts loudly droning Any non-angulotl adjacent to an angulotl makes an **Intuition test.**
>
> - **≤11:** 5 sonic damage; slowed (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 4 sonic damage
> - **17+:** No effect.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Rainfall (7 Malice)**
>
> An angulotl calls clouds to cover the encounter map and unleash rain until the end of the round. Any creature or object that is exposed to the sky is wet until the end of the encounter.

###### On Angulotls

> They like humans! Adults tend to freak them out a little. I don't think they realize tall humans are the same species as tiny humans!

###### Angulotl Tactics

<!-- -->
> **Angulotl Tactics**
>
> Angulotls are not generally aggressive, and if confronted, a patrol of frog folk will usually exchange a few blows before performing a harrying retreat to their hidden villages. In defense of their homes, however, they become much fiercer and more determined. In these battles, angulotls try to force fights in or near water to take advantage of their amphibious nature and the wet effect.
>
> Simple patrols are usually made up of slippery captains leaping into the backline and harassing low-Stamina heroes while their minion hordes keep higher-Stamina heroes engaged. In larger engagements their tactics become more defensive to protect their high-value units. They tend to stay in close and coherent groups to take advantage of support abilities.

## Animals

The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal-to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to *become* monsters. A hero wouldn't mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves-but they'll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.

### Animal Traits

This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal's most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block's EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.

<!-- -->
> **Lots of Options!**
>
> When using animal traits, think about using one mobility trait and either a defensive or an offensive trait to capture the sense of the animal. Other animal traits that don't need to be on the stat block can emerge naturally through gameplay, such as a cat taking no damage from a fall.

#### Animal Stat Blocks

The following stat blocks can be used to describe everyday animals capable of acting as threats or challenges to the heroes under appropriate circumstances. Alternatively, you can add traits to these stat blocks to describe animals of a specific type. If you're adding traits to animal stat blocks, build out your custom animals ahead of time to lessen the amount of flipping back and forth between stat blocks and traits during play.

#### Animal Notation

When building an animal by adding traits to a stat block, you can use a shorthand to describe the animal. For example, a dire wolf might be denoted as "Predator B: Swiftness, Pack, Hunter" to indicate that you're using the Predator B stat block with the Swiftness, Pack, and Hunter traits.

The Example Animals table breaks out a number of animals using this notation. Selected traits are listed in order by category-mobility, defensive, offensive, and supernatural.

<!-- -->
> **Can I Make a Harmless Animal?**
>
> You certainly can! Animal traits can be applied to the **noncombatant** stat block to make unimposing animals the heroes can rescue (see Harmless Creatures in the Introduction section). Surviving a wild animal attack can also be handled through group tests and montage tests as if those animals were environmental challenges to overcome rather than individual threats.

## Arixx

Pebbles dance as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon's peace, and an arixx blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.

An arixx is a chitinous burrowing insectoid beast who stands taller than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.

#### Pastoral Pest

Although arixxi can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. An arixx hunts alone, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make the arixx virtually impossible to eradicate-unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain arixx.

#### Terror of the Thaw

Arixxi are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, arixxi hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace. But this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every arixx awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.

###### Arixx Malice

A creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space on the ground and can't burrow sinks 1 square into the ground.

## Ashen Hoarder

Grave robbing is a dangerous business, but necromancers need bodies for their experiments. To procure supplies and stay out of danger, these mages build ashen hoarders-hulking constructs made of magically reinforced humanoid bones.

### Appendages and Spikes

Ashen hoarders sport four long legs made from compact columns of bone, allowing them to move quickly and avoid creatures who might try to hinder the construct's grim work. Powerful clawed arms aid the hoarder in digging up corpses and fighting enemies.

When an ashen hoarder obtains corpses, they impale them on the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with corruptive energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer's door.

### Weaponized Bodies

These automatons are equipped to protect their cargo. If enemies corner an ashen hoarder, the construct can use the energy stored within their corpses to reanimate them as deadly mines, detonating the remains with explosive corruptive energy. Once the threat is dead, the ashen hoarder can retrieve the enemies' remains and recollect the pieces of their original load.

### Soul Shackle

Creating and powering an ashen hoarder requires a vast amount of necromantic energy. Along with an entire ossuary worth of bones to construct its body, powering the construct requires a soul. That soul is divided between the hoarder and an object known as a Soul Shackle usually a ring or an amulet-that is used to command the construct. Destroying the Soul Shackle can free the trapped soul, but doing so sends an ashen hoarder into an indiscriminate unshackled rage as they feel part of their stolen soul shredded into oblivion. The construct lashes out against any living creature they can before collapsing in on themself. Freeing the soul still trapped inside the ashen hoarder's remains requires completing the Find a Cure downtime project in *[Draw Steel: Heroes](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Heroes)* and the assistance of a powerful holy figure.

## Basilisks

With eight legs, a scaled rough hide, and razor-sharp teeth coated in poison, the basilisk is a deadly threat-even aside from their petrifying eye beams. This dreadful creature can fell the mightiest of foes with a look, turning them into an immobilized stone statue who remains thankfully unaware when the basilisk later consumes their petrified form at their leisure.

### Raising Young

Basilisks typically live in mated pairs and raise small clutches of younglings from the comforts of damp caves. Adults prefer to subsist on berries, fish, fowl, and carrion, resorting to eating their petrified victims only when starving. By contrast, basilisk younglings can eat only petrified victims, and basilisks have been known to travel far from their nest to populated areas in search of prey for their babies.

### Dangerous Servitors

Crime lords and overminds seek basilisk eggs to hatch, raising and training basilisks as bodyguards and pets. Training is dangerous, and many handlers (and their unscrupulous colleagues) find themselves turned to stone when a basilisk escapes and runs amok.

Some creatures keep basilisks not for their terrifying abilities, but for their immunity to petrification. Medusas commonly keep basilisks as pets, owing to their own limited options for companionship. Both parties benefit from this relationship, as the medusa feeds their own victims to the basilisk and their younglings.

### Alchemical Properties

Alchemists have discovered a gland in the basilisk's mouth that excretes an oil that reverts stone to flesh, making it easier to digest prey. If enough of the oil is collected, a salve can be created to restore a petrified victim. Unsavory alchemists pay good money to those willing to steal a basilisk youngling from their nest.

<!-- -->

> | -------------------------- | -------------: |
> | **📏 5 x 2 line within 1** | **🎯 Special** |
>
> **Special:** The area extends from both the tonguesnapper's eyes, and this ability targets the first creature without cover on either side of the area.
>
> **Power Roll + 2:**
>
> - **≤11:** A < 0 restrained (save ends)
> - **12-16:** A < 1 restrained (save ends)
> - **17+:** Slowed (save ends); or if M < 2 restrained (save ends)
>
> **Effect:** If a target is already slowed, the potency increases by 1 for that target. A target restrained this way magically begins to turn to stone, and a target who ends two consecutive turns restrained this way is petrified. A target restrained this way or a creature adjacent to them can use a main action to cut encroaching stone from the target's body, dealing 8 damage to the target that can't be reduced in any way and ending this effect.
