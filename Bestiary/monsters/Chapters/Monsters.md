## Ajax the Invincible

"On behalf of the college, I would like to thank Lord Alvaro for his excellent lecture. The whole school owes you a debt for donating your time today. We will now open the floor to questions. Before we do, I would like to remind you that we enjoy a certain amount of informality here at the war college, but when speaking to Lord Alvaro, let not informality topple over into *familiarity.* We will take the first question now. Francis?"

"Thank you, sir. Lord Alvaro, what we just heard on the topic of Ajax's strategy was pretty chilling. In your opinion, as someone who knew him, how serious is he with his stance on non-humans in Orden? And how should we reconcile this with the treaties he signed with the elves and dwarves of Vasloria? Thank you for your time, my lord."

"Ah, yes," Alvaro said, eyebrows raised theatrically. "Jack's famous 'pro-human' rhetoric." And there was a susurration among the students. For the last hour, Lord Alvaro had only referred to the subject of his lecture as "Ajax." Everyone in the city knew Ajax and Alvaro attended university together, but for the first time, the students in the lecture hall understood-they had been *friends*.

"The short answer is: no. I don't believe Jack is a raving ah... 'human supremacist,' as the broadsheets put it. That's Mortum. But he does find the idea *useful*.

"I spoke for the last hour on Jack's *tactics*. But let's talk about his high-level goals for a moment. Remember everything I just said about Vasloria. The unique problems it presents to someone like Jack. Vasloria is probably as complex a problem as Ajax will ever face. No centralized government, no infrastructure. There's no Vaslorian equivalent of the Heliopolis, or Capital, Kashiato, or Qarat al Ya'tib. So how does one *conquer* a region with no unified identity and no central command?

"Well, you *create* that identity. Consider, before the coming of Ajax, most humans in the region only knew the elves and dwarves as a source of trade! Commerce. Large-scale battles were mostly fought between human duchies.

"Ajax systematically *defeats* those dukes, replacing them with... no one, and he forces the elves and dwarves to sign treaties at swordpoint. Like the dwarves of Kal Kalavar. They pay tribute to Ajax in forced labor. They don't send *dwarves*, oh no! They capture *humans*. Those unsuited for labor go into the Body Banks.

"So, what has Jack done? He's chopped the head off the feudal system in Vasloria leaving only far-flung baronies to fend for themselves. The people feel scared, alone. Leaderless. If the people use the roads, they risk capture by the dwarves; if they use the woods for resources, they're cut down by the elves. So they learn to *distrust* the elves and dwarves.

"I think it's a stroke of genius. *Conquering* all of Vasloria by force would be a long and bloody affair. Instead, he creates the conditions that will allow him to *save* Vasloria. He lets this field lie fallow for a few years, and, when he returns, there'll be a whole generation of young people who do not remember a time when the roads or forests were safe. Who *hate* the dwarves and elves. When Ajax returns, they will welcome him as their protector and he will unite them *against* these new enemies.

"It's a long plan, but I can't see any way it won't work. Uniting humans by pitting them against everyone else in Orden is a strategy I think he'll rely on more and more. It's working very well for him. Next question."

"Lord Alvaro, according to the broadsheets, there are many new churches in Vasloria dedicated to 'Saint' Ajax. Do you believe this is part of his grand strategy? Thank you, my lord."

"That's Mortum's doing, I'm sure of it. Mortum was a great believer in the power of religion as a tool to manipulate societies. If Jack's given it any thought at all, he'd see it as a sound strategy for his plan to return as, not just the protector, but the *savior* of the land. I suspect if Mortum hadn't pushed the idea, Jack would have thought of it sooner or later. The Pharoah of Khemhara commands *enormous* power, more than any political leader in all Orden, because uniquely he is both head of state and the chief religious officer. Even the emperors of Caelila didn't think of that. Next question."

"Thank you. Lord Alvaro, *if* Ajax is trying to conquer the world... do you think he will succeed?"

"Yes. Unless there's rapid agreement between all the powers of the world to work together and stop him? Yes, he's going to win. It's precisely because he knew such an alliance of powers was practically impossible that he even considered a Caelian-style campaign of conquest in the first place.

"Next question."

### On Ajax

He bestrides the land like one of history's great conquerors. A combination of ambition, courage, and study created a master tactician in command of a massive army collecting countless priceless treasures-and no one to stand in his way.

#### By Might and Merit

Ajax the Invincible has earned his title. He graduated top of his class at Capital's military academy, and then immediately launched into a campaign across his homeland of Phaedros. At his side was his advisor Mortum, a nefarious wizard who guided Ajax in the footsteps of the Caelian Empire's conquests before them.

Together, Ajax and Mortum went on to subjugate and enlist hamlet after town after city after territory with little standing in their way. When they successfully returned the Chrysopolis-an ancient flying sky-elf city-to the sky, and their accomplishments literally rose above the country-no one could ignore their might any longer.

#### Treasures Abound

Ajax lays claims to many powerful treasures, both gifted to him in exchange for sanctuary and taken by his own hands. The Mantle of the Phoenix Queen, a harness that conjures the wings of a phoenix. Uthgryl, the Negotiator, Blade of the Gol King, a sword so sharp that it could cleave a person's willpower in two. The Hand of Kukai, a gauntlet plated in jade that harbors powerful, forbidden magic.

His arsenal is vast and strategically picked to round out his strength. There are few situations he isn't prepared to handle.

#### The Iron Saint

While some of his forces may refer to Ajax as the Iron Saint, the version of him presented here hasn't taken up that title yet. Ajax the Invincible will continue to amass followers, treasures, and titles until he can ascend to his rightful status as a saint. It's up to the heroes to make sure this will never come to pass.

#### Ajax's Languages

Ajax speaks Caelian, Higaran, Khoursirian, Phaedran, Riojan, Vaniric, and Vaslorian.

<!-- -->
> **Ajax the Leader**
>
> Ajax is a master tactician. It would stand to reason that he can enter battle leading an army instead of facing the heroes solo.
>
> Future adventures might feature different iterations and stat blocks for Ajax. For now, you can convert Ajax the Invincible into a level 11 leader with the following adjustments:
>
> - Reduce his encounter value to EV 52.
> - Reduce his Stamina to 280.
> - Remove his **Ajax Turns** trait.
> - Remove all his maneuvers.
> - Add the following maneuver:
>
> **Strike Them Down** Two allies within 10 squares of Ajax each move up to their speed and can use a signature ability.
>
> - Adjust the **I'm Not Done Yet** trait so that Ajax dies at −140 Stamina instead of −350.

###### Tactical Stance (Ajax Feature)

At the start of each round, Ajax chooses a new stance from one of the following options and gains its benefits:

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Insurgent**
>
> Ajax automatically treats his initial power roll as a 17. He can still roll to determine if he scores a critical hit.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Mastermind**
>
> Before he uses an ability, Ajax can either shift up to 2 squares, or can cause one creature within line of effect to slide up to 2 squares, ignoring stability.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Vanguard**
>
> Ajax has damage immunity 5. Additionally, any enemy who makes a power roll that includes Ajax as a target has a double bane on the roll.

###### Ajax's Malice

At the start of Ajax's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Reason (2 Malice)**
>
> Ajax attempts to instill doubt into a creature within line of effect through logic and reason. The creature and Ajax make an opposed Reason test. If Ajax wins, he chooses to either deal 11 extra damage to one target on his next strike or to gain an additional triggered action during the current round. Ajax can't use this feature against the same creature during the same encounter.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Nexus Jewel (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, Ajax chooses one of the following environments he has previously visited and overlays that environment on top of the encounter map, temporarily merging multiple realities.
>
> **Incredibly High Above the Ground:** The winds whip and bluster. Any creature who can't fly takes a −3 penalty to stability, and forced movement effects gain a +3 bonus to their distance against such creatures.
>
> **Swamp:** The ground is difficult terrain for enemies. Any creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space is restrained (save ends).
>
> **Volcanic Canyon:** The air is stiflingly hot. Each enemy takes 5 fire damage for each square they enter.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> Ajax takes an additional main action on his turn. He can use this feature even if he is dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Draw Steel (10 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Magic, Ranged, Weapon** |                          **Main Action** |
> | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------: |
> | **📏 Four 3 cubes within 10**   | **🎯 Each enemy and object in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** Each target makes a test using their highest characteristic.
>
> - **≤11:** 26 damage; bleeding and slowed (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 22 damage; bleeding (save ends)
> - **17+:** 16 damage
>
> Ajax then raises his Blade of the Gol King above his head as four giant blades emerge from the ground to fill the area. Each target is pushed into an unoccupied space adjacent to the area after the power roll is resolved. Each blade blocks line of effect and can be dismissed by Ajax at will (no action required).

## Angulotls

Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa-LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they're threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.

#### Deadly Toxins

Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression-because they don't need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.

#### Indicator Species

Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn't take much to upset that balance. While toxins don't kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path-even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most-and sometimes grants them strange abilities.

#### Moisture Dependent

Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it's raining.

#### Clawfish

Known as q'ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.

#### Angulotl Languages

Most angulotls speak Filliaric.

#### Wet

Angulotls make use of a unique effect called "wet." While wet, an angulotl doesn't provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.

###### Angulotl Malice

At the start of any angulotl's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Leapfrog (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, when an angulotl moves through an inactive angulotl's space, the inactive angulotl can use a free triggered action to jump 3 squares.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Resonating Croak (5 Malice)**
>
> Each angulotl in the encounter puffs out their throat and starts loudly droning Any non-angulotl adjacent to an angulotl makes an **Intuition test.**
>
> - **≤11:** 5 sonic damage; slowed (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 4 sonic damage
> - **17+:** No effect.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Rainfall (7 Malice)**
>
> An angulotl calls clouds to cover the encounter map and unleash rain until the end of the round. Any creature or object that is exposed to the sky is wet until the end of the encounter.

###### On Angulotls

> They like humans! Adults tend to freak them out a little. I don't think they realize tall humans are the same species as tiny humans!

###### Angulotl Tactics

<!-- -->
> **Angulotl Tactics**
>
> Angulotls are not generally aggressive, and if confronted, a patrol of frog folk will usually exchange a few blows before performing a harrying retreat to their hidden villages. In defense of their homes, however, they become much fiercer and more determined. In these battles, angulotls try to force fights in or near water to take advantage of their amphibious nature and the wet effect.
>
> Simple patrols are usually made up of slippery captains leaping into the backline and harassing low-Stamina heroes while their minion hordes keep higher-Stamina heroes engaged. In larger engagements their tactics become more defensive to protect their high-value units. They tend to stay in close and coherent groups to take advantage of support abilities.

## Animals

The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal-to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to *become* monsters. A hero wouldn't mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves-but they'll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.

### Animal Traits

This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal's most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block's EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.

<!-- -->
> **Lots of Options!**
>
> When using animal traits, think about using one mobility trait and either a defensive or an offensive trait to capture the sense of the animal. Other animal traits that don't need to be on the stat block can emerge naturally through gameplay, such as a cat taking no damage from a fall.

#### Animal Stat Blocks

The following stat blocks can be used to describe everyday animals capable of acting as threats or challenges to the heroes under appropriate circumstances. Alternatively, you can add traits to these stat blocks to describe animals of a specific type. If you're adding traits to animal stat blocks, build out your custom animals ahead of time to lessen the amount of flipping back and forth between stat blocks and traits during play.

#### Animal Notation

When building an animal by adding traits to a stat block, you can use a shorthand to describe the animal. For example, a dire wolf might be denoted as "Predator B: Swiftness, Pack, Hunter" to indicate that you're using the Predator B stat block with the Swiftness, Pack, and Hunter traits.

The Example Animals table breaks out a number of animals using this notation. Selected traits are listed in order by category-mobility, defensive, offensive, and supernatural.

<!-- -->
> **Can I Make a Harmless Animal?**
>
> You certainly can! Animal traits can be applied to the **noncombatant** stat block to make unimposing animals the heroes can rescue (see Harmless Creatures in the Introduction section). Surviving a wild animal attack can also be handled through group tests and montage tests as if those animals were environmental challenges to overcome rather than individual threats.

## Arixx

Pebbles dance as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon's peace, and an arixx blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.

An arixx is a chitinous burrowing insectoid beast who stands taller than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.

#### Pastoral Pest

Although arixxi can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. An arixx hunts alone, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make the arixx virtually impossible to eradicate-unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain arixx.

#### Terror of the Thaw

Arixxi are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, arixxi hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace. But this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every arixx awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.

###### Arixx Malice

At the start of an arixx's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

A creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space on the ground and can't burrow sinks 1 square into the ground.

## Ashen Hoarder

Grave robbing is a dangerous business, but necromancers need bodies for their experiments. To procure supplies and stay out of danger, these mages build ashen hoarders-hulking constructs made of magically reinforced humanoid bones.

### Appendages and Spikes

Ashen hoarders sport four long legs made from compact columns of bone, allowing them to move quickly and avoid creatures who might try to hinder the construct's grim work. Powerful clawed arms aid the hoarder in digging up corpses and fighting enemies.

When an ashen hoarder obtains corpses, they impale them on the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with corruptive energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer's door.

### Weaponized Bodies

These automatons are equipped to protect their cargo. If enemies corner an ashen hoarder, the construct can use the energy stored within their corpses to reanimate them as deadly mines, detonating the remains with explosive corruptive energy. Once the threat is dead, the ashen hoarder can retrieve the enemies' remains and recollect the pieces of their original load.

### Soul Shackle

Creating and powering an ashen hoarder requires a vast amount of necromantic energy. Along with an entire ossuary worth of bones to construct its body, powering the construct requires a soul. That soul is divided between the hoarder and an object known as a Soul Shackle usually a ring or an amulet-that is used to command the construct. Destroying the Soul Shackle can free the trapped soul, but doing so sends an ashen hoarder into an indiscriminate unshackled rage as they feel part of their stolen soul shredded into oblivion. The construct lashes out against any living creature they can before collapsing in on themself. Freeing the soul still trapped inside the ashen hoarder's remains requires completing the Find a Cure downtime project in *[Draw Steel: Heroes](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Heroes)* and the assistance of a powerful holy figure.

## Basilisks

With eight legs, a scaled rough hide, and razor-sharp teeth coated in poison, the basilisk is a deadly threat-even aside from their petrifying eye beams. This dreadful creature can fell the mightiest of foes with a look, turning them into an immobilized stone statue who remains thankfully unaware when the basilisk later consumes their petrified form at their leisure.

### Raising Young

Basilisks typically live in mated pairs and raise small clutches of younglings from the comforts of damp caves. Adults prefer to subsist on berries, fish, fowl, and carrion, resorting to eating their petrified victims only when starving. By contrast, basilisk younglings can eat only petrified victims, and basilisks have been known to travel far from their nest to populated areas in search of prey for their babies.

### Dangerous Servitors

Crime lords and overminds seek basilisk eggs to hatch, raising and training basilisks as bodyguards and pets. Training is dangerous, and many handlers (and their unscrupulous colleagues) find themselves turned to stone when a basilisk escapes and runs amok.

Some creatures keep basilisks not for their terrifying abilities, but for their immunity to petrification. Medusas commonly keep basilisks as pets, owing to their own limited options for companionship. Both parties benefit from this relationship, as the medusa feeds their own victims to the basilisk and their younglings.

### Alchemical Properties

Alchemists have discovered a gland in the basilisk's mouth that excretes an oil that reverts stone to flesh, making it easier to digest prey. If enough of the oil is collected, a salve can be created to restore a petrified victim. Unsavory alchemists pay good money to those willing to steal a basilisk youngling from their nest.

<!-- -->

## Bredbeddle

In their true forms, bredbeddles are ogre-sized headless giants. Forever searching for their missing heads, they are drawn to populous lands, where they decapitate passers-by and magically adopt their victims' forms.

Although bredbeddles have no traditional sensory organs of their own, they are keenly aware of their surroundings. Some lurk along dark country lanes in their monstrous true forms. Others walk disguised among crowds, dropping their facade only long enough to waylay a stranger and lop off their head.

### Immortal Wanderers

Bredbeddles don't age, and if they are slain, their bodies reform a few days later. Long ago, bredbeddles were giants who stood high among the nobility of giant kind. But when they declared themselves rulers of all giant kind, their kin thwarted the coup and beheaded the bredbeddles. Now these fallen nobles search the world for their missing heads, each wielding the axe that decapitated them. Tales tell of how their heads are kept for safekeeping in a fire giant's cellar to be returned after an indeterminate period of good behavior, which no bredbeddle has exhibited thus far.

### Green with Frenzy

The longer a bredbeddle goes without a head, the more twisted and desperate their power grows. Their desire to be whole stretches out of their body in the form of shadowy dark-green ribbons, wrapping around and clinging to every surface they spill onto.

Travelers warn one another of roads rumored to be haunted by "wild green knights," often avoiding these routes for months. No journey is worth losing your head over.

### Bredbeddle Languages

When a bredbeddle communicates, they typically use High Kuric or the languages that their head's previous owner knew. A bredbeddle who has taken multiple heads over their lifetime most likely knows Caelian as well.

###### Bredbeddle Malice

At the start of a bredbeddle's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Engreen (3 Malice)**
>
> The bredbeddle's axe lengthens and turns a ghastly green, granting a +1 bonus to the distance of the bredbeddle's melee strikes and the dimensions of their burst area abilities until the end of their turn.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Shadow Stockade (5 Malice)**
>
> A ghostly size 1L stockade seeps out from under the bredbeddle's feet to fill an unoccupied square within 10 squares. When a size 1L or smaller enemy enters the stockade's square, they are restrained (save ends). When a restrained creature is no longer restrained, the stockade fades away. At the start of each of the bredbeddle's turns, they can slide an active stockade and any creature in it up to 5 squares.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The bredbeddle takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Green Phantom (7 Malice)**
>
> A phantom second bredbeddle phases into view, appearing in an unoccupied space anywhere on the encounter map, then vanishing at the end of the round. The phantom bredbeddle shares the original bredbeddle's statistics but has 24 Stamina, corruption immunity 10, and can fly. The phantom bredbeddle can take one turn and use any of the bredbeddle's abilities except for villain actions. Only one phantom bredbeddle can be active at a time.

> ☠️ **Solo Monster**
>
> **End Effect:** At the end of each of their turns, the bredbeddle can take 5 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.
>
> **Solo Turns:** The bredbeddle can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Heady or Not**
>
> While headless, the bredbeddle can move into a space containing a severed head and attach it to their neck as a main action. Doing so physically transforms the bredbeddle, who takes on the appearance, size, weight, and stability of the head's original owner. If the bredbeddle takes the form of a creature of size 1L or smaller, the distance of their melee and burst area abilities decreases by 1. These effects last until the bredbeddle is killed or beheaded, or until the head falls off after 24 hours. A head that falls off this way can no longer be attached to this bredbeddle.
>
> A creature must succeed on a **hard Might test** made as a maneuver to rip a head off the bredbeddle. If they fail, the bredbeddle can make a free strike against them.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Resilient Form**
>
> The bredbeddle can't be physically transformed in any way except by their Heady or Not trait.

> **Effect:** A beheaded target has their head fall into an unoccupied square adjacent to the bredbeddle, but they remain alive. While beheaded this way, the target is bleeding and has line of effect only to adjacent squares. The beheaded target can survive without their head for 24 hours, and can reattach their head as a maneuver by entering its square. A target who remains beheaded for 24 hours dies.

## Bugbears

Bugbears are the bu'gath in the Khelt language, or "the bearers of the great fear." Modern bugbears come from early goblins who first stepped into the wode centuries ago. Fey magic twisted their bodies, making them grow imposingly tall and hairy while removing all sound from their footsteps.

Many bugbears become legendary hunters and mercenaries. Many more become reclusive and hide their whole lives in the shadows. A rare few dive into their magic potential and become living nightmares who haunt the wode.

### Thrown Into the Fray

Bugbears seldom seek the settlements of others for trade or allyship, and are known to tenaciously defend their own homes or their neighbors' homes. This has given them a reputation of being covert, insurgent warriors, when in reality, bugbears simply fight to maintain their quiet solitude.

When bugbears are compelled to take action, they take to the high ground and use their powerful arms to throw anything they can down at the problem. This includes daggers, heavy iron balls, each other, and sometimes throwing the enemy at the enemy.

### Goblin Bond

Bugbears value their shared origin with goblins and hobgoblins despite the three lines branching apart so dramatically. They think of themselves as goblinoids first and humanoids second, with that relationship providing a sense of common ground when cloistered bugbears come out of isolation.

###### Bugbear Malice

At the start of any bugbear's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Goblin Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The bugbear activates a Malice Feature available to goblins.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Grab Iron Ball (3+ Malice)**
>
> For every 3 Malice spent, one non-minion bugbear acting this turn grabs an iron ball and can use a maneuver to throw it at a creature within 5 squares of them. The creature takes damage equal to 8 - the number of squares the iron ball was thrown, and if they have M < 1, they are slowed (save ends).

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Grab Javelin (5+ Malice)**
>
> For every 5 Malice spent, one non-minion bugbear acting this turn grabs a javelin and can use a maneuver to throw it at a creature within 5 squares of them. The creature takes damage equal to 12 - the number of squares the javelin was thrown, and if they have M < 1, they are bleeding (save ends). While a creature is bleeding this way, any ally of the bugbear within 2 squares of them can use a free maneuver to pull the bleeding creature up to 2 squares.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Show Them the Great Fear (10 Malice)**
>
> A bugbear infuses the encounter map with bu'gathic magic. Until the end of the encounter, all bugbears and allies have their speed doubled and can automatically climb at full speed while moving. Additionally, if the target of any bugbear or ally's strike has I < 1, the target is also frightened (save ends) and must move their speed in a straight line away from the creature who made the strike.

### Bu'gathic Magic

Most bugbears have some control over their inherent magic, enabling them to perform a trick or two. Dedicated bugbear channelers have learned to evoke powerful shadow and rot magic. These mages can reshape the appearance of the world around them and temporarily alter their foes as defensive tactics, providing ample warning to enemies that they are capable of far worse if those enemies push onward. Bu'gathic magic also enables bugbears to hide their settlements behind shadowy veils within canyons and impenetrable swamplands.

### Bugbear Languages

Most bugbears speak Caelian, Khelt, and Szetch.

## Chimera

Massive flexing claws. Lashing draconic tail. Nimble leathery wings. And not one, but three menacing heads: a snarling lion, a helix-horned ram, and a dragon with fire sparking in their throat. Many see the chimera as an aggressor-but few know this creature's origins as a divine guardian.

### The First Chimera

The first chimera was a gift. A deity gave a devout queen this young guardian-one with a dragon's cunning, a lion's bravery, and a ram's tenacity. The queen raised the chimera to be a strong protector not just for herself but also her people, who loved the chimera and their ruler. But neighboring lands feared the beast. As a conquering force swept into the land, slaughtering the chimera was their fell goal.

The queen's resulting fury was said to be felt by the gods. As she screamed, a nearby volcano erupted, spewing basalt and chimeras over the land. With fiery might, the chimeras destroyed the opposing army, then dispersed. Each found a new territory and claimed the role of divine protector over that place, its inhabitants, and its treasures.

### Tactical Warriors

Chimeras have many ways to keep themselves and their charges from being cornered. The lion head snaps up enemies in massive jaws and hurls them away, the ram head pummels them to the ground, and the dragon head bathes them in fire. The three heads crying out together can shake even the most stalwart warriors.

### One Being, Three Heads

Unlike some other multiheaded creatures, a chimera possesses a single unified mind. Their heads work together, never snapping at one another over food, favors, or personality conflicts. The heads often express the chimera's emotions in unison, braying together in times of battle or purring all at once to show affection.

###### Chimera Malice

At the start of a chimera's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Defensive Snapping (3 Malice)**
>
> The chimera takes up a defensive stance. Until the start of their next turn, the chimera can make a free strike against each enemy who comes within 2 squares of them.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The chimera takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Unstable Terrain (5 Malice)**
>
> The chimera shakes the ground, causing an eruption of loose rocks and debris that creates three size 2 stone objects anywhere on the encounter map. Each creature adjacent to one or more objects when they appear who has A < 2 takes 5 damage.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Ashen Clouds (7 Malice)**
>
> Until the start of the chimera's next turn, all areas of the encounter map are shrouded in a thick cloud of ash. All creatures and objects on the map have concealment that the chimera ignores. Additionally, each enemy in the cloud who has I < 1 has line of effect only within 3 squares. The potency of this feature increases by 1 each time it's used.

## Demons

Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun.

The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.

### Mortal Alliances

Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.

### Soul Reavers

Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.

### Lethe

When a demon's soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe-a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.

### Demonic Hierarchy

Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don't use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service.

Each time a demon consumes a soul, there's a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt-or heroic.

### Demon Languages

Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.

### Demons-1st Echelon

A number of lesser demons have been identified across categories 1 to 3.

**Pitlings** resemble rodents or insects with gleaming green eyes and terrible body odor, and disgorge a viscous, toxic phlegm.

**Ensnarers** are the result of pitlings getting hold of an unfortunate soul. A pitling in the process of digesting the soul of a creature has that soul physically bore through their head to become a fanged appendage. Mouths form across the creature's body, each attacking with long, barbed tongues.

**Frenzieds** are similar to ensnarers, but their transformation into a true demon is more advanced. This results in a fast and vicious creature full of energy and hungry for more souls.

**Bendraks** (BEN-drax) appear as an amalgamation of flesh and the shards of broken mirrors, which they use to distract and confuse their foes. A bendrak can divert an enemy's attack to another enemy, and can hide themselves or allies behind dazzling reflections.

**Mucerons** (MIU-sur-onz) are the result of an ensnarer going through repeated demon evolutions to become a brutish creature. They are covered in multiple mouths that shoot out barbed tongues, tearing at enemies as they are dragged out of position.

**Remasches** (REE-mash-iz) have physical forms blended with the nature of the wastes where they dwell. A remasch teleports around the battlefield, inflicting chaos on their enemies directly or through the minions they control. These demons are rumored to be the initial source of the teachings of all shadows through the College of Black Ash.

**Ruinants** (rew-in-ANSE) are possessed of glowing eyes and tendrilringed maws, their bodies covered in inflamed scars and their breath coming as a sickening wheeze. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the demon's own body.

**Torlases** (TORR-lahs-iz) are piecemeal abominations whose physical forms don't obey the mundane laws of geometry. They control the battlefield by using living flesh and whipping allies and enemies alike into advantageous position.

**Chorogaunts** (cor-roh-GAWNTS) are terrifying demon leaders. Each is an amalgamation of several demon bodies formed into a mobile musical instrument. Several heads are arranged into a chorus embedded in the demon's chest, and their ribs are upturned into a fleshy pipe organ. Their attacks entrance and confuse enemies, making them more vulnerable to other demons.

###### Demon Malice (Level 1+ Malice Features)

At the start of any demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Soulburn (3 Malice)**
>
> Each demon acting this turn has a double edge on abilities.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Abyssal Evolution (7 Malice)**
>
> A demon minion of your choice transforms into a non-minion horde demon of the same level.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Abyssal Rift (7 Malice)**
>
> Two size 2 rifts to the Abyssal Wasteland appear at locations of your choice. Any demon can use an abyssal rift as a portal to another abyssal rift in the encounter, moving into any space in one rift and appearing immediately in any unoccupied space in the other rift. A non-demon who enters a rift for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes corruption damage equal to the level of the highest-level demon on the encounter map. An abyssal rift is an immovable object that has 25 Stamina, damage immunity 2, and holy weakness 5. The rift closes when there are no demons remaining on the encounter map. Additionally, a creature who has the Magic or Psionics skill can make a Reason test or Intuition test as a maneuver while adjacent to a rift to destabilize and close it.
>
> - **≤11:** The rift remains open and regains 5 Stamina.
> - **12-16:** The rift remains open.
> - **17+:** The rift closes.

### Demons-2nd Echelon

As demons consume more souls and their mercurial forms shift into more powerful ones, they begin to evolve more distinct personalities, desires, and intelligence-often based on the souls consumed. Across categories 4 to 6, demons develop a particular taste for certain types of souls, which eventually come to define them should they survive long enough.

**Grulqins** (GRUHL-kinz) consist of a bulbous head, two powerful arms, and a circular serrated blade of bone that runs down the middle of their head.

**Orliq** (or-LEEK) are made of shifting bone plates surrounding a swirling core of corruptive energy.

**Wobalas** (WOH-buh-luss) prefer to kill from afar while protected by allies, firing psychic bolts from bows shaped of their own flesh and sinew.

**Bale eyes**, sometimes called "flesh moons," are colossal floating orbs of roiling, dripping flesh. A weeping seam in that flesh opens to reveal a demonic eye whose gaze turns creatures' mental and physical faculties upside down.

**Fanglings** have bodies overgrown with teeth, fangs, and tusks from countless creatures. They are deadly in close quarters, to attackers and bystanders alike.

**Fiktin** (FIK-ten) are cunning hunters who disguise themselves as mundane objects, leaving a foul-smelling oily red residue wherever they have been. Their true form is a humanoid shape made of red oil.

**Gunge** (GUHNJ) demons are horrifically distended, with maws that can swallow a horse whole. A gunge vomits up bilious slime that traps and dissolves any creature unlucky enough to get caught in it.

**Tourmenauks** (tor-min-AUX) resemble a hulking ape with a dozen or more extra mouths distributed around their body. Though their brute force is formidable, this demon also inflicts raw psychic pain by wailing from their mouths in different voices-often the agonized voices of souls the tormenauk has devoured.

**Lumbering egresses** are mobile masses of warped flesh set around an enormous whirling portal to the demonic realms. Lesser demons pour out through these portals at alarming rates, letting these creatures act as devastating siege engines.

###### Demon Malice (Level 4+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 4 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level or lower.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Abyssal Jaunt (3 Malice)**
>
> One demon acting this turn folds space around them, temporarily slipping in and out of the Abyssal Wasteland. Until the start of the demon's next turn, they ignore difficult terrain, can move through solid matter, and don't provoke opportunity attacks by moving. If the demon ends their turn inside solid matter, they are shunted out into the space from which they entered it.

### Demons-3rd Echelon

Demons of categories 7 to 9 continue to mutate in new and unpredictable ways, or are sometimes corrupted and spawned from other powerful creatures to become part of the demonic hierarchy. Additionally, in a plane of chaos, the soulraker demon is notable for fashioning a facsimile of order within themself. These demonic wasps make up a single, chaotic hive mind. They serve a demonic hivequeen, who relies on cannibalizing her children to ingest any souls they've consumed.

**Soulraker scouts** are the vile progeny of a soulraker hivequeen demonic wasps who emerge from her distended abdomen with an earsplitting buzz.

**Soulraker soldiers** are demonic wasps armored in dense chitin who favor driving foes before them.

**Soulraker stingers** are wasps covered in poisonous barbed stingers that they launch like quills, their wings atrophied and unusable.

**Blight phages** were once angelic creatures. Corrupted by demonic forces, each is now a cruel, distended mockery of a cherubic form, covered in pestilent boils that seep ruinous blight.

**Chimerons** (kai-MEHR-ons) are a horrifying amalgam of multiple demonic forms melded into a unique monstrosity, driven by an unslakable hunger for souls.

**Styrichs** (STEE-rix) feature lanky bodies covered with manes of long, razor-sharp hair, which they whip around the battlefield to shred their enemies.

**Soulraker handmaidens** are abyssal parasites implanted in victims by a soulraker hivequeen. Handmaidens gestate inside a host until they're ready to emerge from the body, then consume souls until they're strong enough to transform into a new hivequeen.

**Soulraker praetorians** are the elite guards of a hivequeen, dripping foul-smelling ichor and using their barbed stingers to lay waste to foes.

A **soulraker hivequeen** is a demonic wasp whose abdomen houses their own soulraker wasp hive, and whose stinging ovipositor implants victims with handmaiden parasites.

###### Demon Malice (Level 7+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 7 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level 6 or lower.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Seeping Blight (5 Malice)**

### Demons-4th Echelon

The more souls a demon consumes, the more they evolve. The more they evolve, the more refined their tastes become, until eventually demons of category 10 can be satisfied only by consuming souls that exemplify particular qualities. Many demons of this category have their tastes honored by their titles, such as Gorgino, the Sensuous Feast; Tyx, the Obliviated Spiral; and Lorikta, the Discarded Dream.

**Optacus** (OHP-tih-cus) demons are abyssal eyes atop a spindly flesh stalk supported by innumerable legs. Able to affix to any surface, they shoot deadly beams of fire at distant foes.

**Tyburakis** (tee-berr-AH-kees) appear as a horrifying cross between a thresher shark and a terror lizard, their tails lined with tiny shark maws that allow them to bite multiple foes at once.

**Unguloids** (UHN-jyl-oids) have a centaur-like form, with a body and head resembling a demonic rhinoceros. They are known for their devastating charge.

**Izyaks** (ee-zi-YAHKS) have a mercurial form that ripples with psionic energy, making these demons appear different to all those who observe them. Their true form is a brain supported on four bone legs.

**Vicisitators** (vih-SIS-ih-tay-tors) are dangerous and horrifically unstable, the flesh and bone of their bodies trapped in a state of perpetual agonizing flux. Their very touch results in excruciating pain as it warps flesh, bone, and soul.

**Aurumvas** (or-UM-vahs) the demon king stands alone among named demons for craving not only wealth, but highly avaricious souls. A towering figure with a stack of crowns atop his ophidian head, he is a vision of opulence, excess, and absolute debasement. He lords over other powerful demons by virtue of the wealth held in his vast vaults in the Abyssal Wasteland, acquired through the slaughter of countless creatures. But even as he gazes upon his riches and supernatural treasures, Aurumvas wants for more. He draws lesser demons and wicked mortals to his service with the promise of minor treasures, knowing full well that one needs to spend wealth to make it. If left unchecked, Aurumvas's servile armies and glittering hoards might one day encompass the entire timescape.

## Devils

In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly for power and control-a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes. Devils are distinguished from other humanoids by skin in shades of azure and crimson, as well as their hellmarks: horns, tails, hooves, wings, and other infernal features.

### Precarious Pyramids

The Seven Cities of Hell stand atop strict hierarchy and bureaucracy. Primordial chains of command place each devil in service to a more powerful devil, with the seven archdevil rulers of Hell at the top. While devils are lawful, they're always looking for another way up the ladder. They twist every rule to their benefit to gain power and usurp those they answer to, eager to uncover loopholes in the eternal struggle for significance and supremacy.

### Silver Tongues

Winsome devils can acquire significant influence by bargaining for the souls of mortals on behalf of the archdevil they ultimately serve. Virtuosos with words, devils are skilled at striking deals and forging contracts. They exploit the weaknesses of mortals, whether greed, revenge, vanity, or simple desperation. In the heat of battle, a devil's supernatural charisma can influence a mortal to do their bidding, often without realizing until it's too late.

<!-- -->
> **Negotiations with Devils**
>
> Devils are eager to negotiate and strike deals, but often require more compelling arguments and concrete evidence from the other party. You can pick from the following motivations and pitfalls to quickly create a devil from one of the Seven Cities for a negotiation (see Chapter 11 in *Draw Steel: Heroes*):
>
> - **Motivation:** Greed, Power, Legacy
> - **Pitfall:** Benevolence, Freedom, Protection
>
> During a negotiation, an NPC devil has their impression and patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Their interest goes up to 10 instead of 5.
>
> When an NPC devil is ready to make an offer, divide their interest by 2 to get their final response. A devil typically never settles a negotiation unless they're promised something desirable in return.

### True Names

All devils have two names: one by which they're commonly known, and another secret true name. Each devil zealously safeguards the latter, as their true name can be spoken aloud to aid in summoning them-or in stripping them of their power.

### Hell's Defectors

Not every devil in the Seven Cities wants to ruthlessly ascend the hierarchy. Some desire advancement, but they remain dissatisfied at the bottom. As luck would have it, these fiends can free themselves from Hell's bureaucracy, for when a mortal overestimates their fortitude and dies while enacting an infernal summoning, it can leave an enterprising devil stranded in the mundane world.

### Devil Languages

Most devils speak Anjal and Caelian, among other languages. The more powerful a devil, the more languages they learn in order to more easily make ironclad contracts with a wide variety of people and cultures. Outside of rare circumstances, devils are always willing to negotiate, ever desiring to twist a situation in their favor.

###### Devil Malice

At the start of any devil's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Bureaucratic Tape (3 Malice)**
>
> One devil acting this turn uses a signature ability against an adjacent creature. On a tier 3 outcome, the target of the ability has a double bane on strikes (save ends).

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Underhanded Tactics (5+ Malice)**
>
> One or two devils can teleport to a space adjacent to one or more creatures who aren't hidden and make a free strike. For each 2 additional Malice spent on this feature, one additional devil can teleport.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Read the Small Print (7 Malice)**
>
> Each enemy in the encounter is subject to a bad deal proposed by the devils. An enemy must choose between having damage weakness 5 or taking a bane on power rolls. The bad deal lasts until the end of the encounter.

<!-- -->
> **Devil Temptations**
>
> Although some devils enjoy comfort and opulence for their own sake, they primarily use treasure as bargaining chips in fiendish compacts: bait on the devils' infernal barbs.
>
> Even more sinister than a prize won in a devil's hard bargain is a gift freely given by a devil. The advantages of such a gift are conditional, lasting only until the devil revokes it at some inconvenient time.
>
> The following are samples of the wonders that a devil can offer-to only the most discriminating customers, of course. A devil might only have two or three of these items available for trade, but others (such as an archdevil's wing) can be won by force. See *Draw Steel: Heroes* for more information about how these items can be used by heroes.
>
> **Components:** An archdevil's wing, archdevil's blood, soul chalk, a wide selection of true names
>
> **Project Sources:** Notes in Anjali for the Devil's Bargain armor enhancement or a Hellcharger Helm, notes in Hyrallic for a Mediator's Charm
>
> **Titles:** Diabolist, Maestro
>
> **Treasures:** G'Allios Visiting Card, Thief of Joy
>
> **Wealth:** Each hero can earn 1 wealth in exchange for a small favor

## Draconians

Draconians-wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden-are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training.

Six individual draconians are presented in this section-not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.

###### Aeolyxria the Uncanny

From the moment she hatched, Aeolyxria (ay-oh-LIX-ree-ah) has enjoyed a fascination with the occult. She wanders the land, gathering strange tomes and artifacts to study. When she takes a job, it's because she has a new doohickey she wants to test out. Aeolyxria possesses a sharp, tactical mind that lets her treat any battlefield as if it offered homefield advantage. If she could just get a handle on all her equipment, she'd be unstoppable!

###### Locratix the Morningstar

A traveler from a faraway land and the sole progeny of her Dracogenesis clutch, Locratix (low-CRA-tics) focuses on survival over all other things. The very concept of the dragon knights is anathema to her, as there is no reason a wyrmwight should hand over the power that keeps them alive. Locratix travels widely while taking on mercenary jobs, but she is always just one better deal away from skewering her present employer on the end of her lance.

###### Lydixavus the Deadeye

Nothing escapes Lydixavus (lee-DIX-uh-vas) or their unrivaled precision. After decades of careful training, they have honed their breath weapon into a swift and far-traveling bullet of ice. Lydixavus is motivated by revenge. Each scar, each dent in their scales tells a story, and Lydixavus aims to return those gifts tenfold to those who bestowed them.

###### Myxovidan the Sintaker

Myxovidan (mix-OH-vih-din) was raised by a secluded order of monks who claimed his obsidian-black scales and nausea-inducing breath were an evil that must be purged. They subjected him to an austere lifestyle, full of intense training, meditation, and denial of worldly pleasures. But Myxovidan's hunger would be satisfied, one way or another. When Myxovidan departed the order, he left behind a collection of emaciated monk corpses who looked as though they'd had the life sucked out of them.

###### Phrrygalax the Subduer

Phrrygalax (fuh-RIJ-ih-lax) was once a dragon knight in the service of Good King Omund. Though he took the oath to defend others against tyranny, he was always keenly aware he was created for violence. When the betrayal of the dragon knight Mandrake fractured the Dragon Phalanx that was the order of the dragon knights, Phrrygalax gleefully renounced his oath to follow what he believes to be his true, brutal purpose. Many who served with him believed he was merely waiting for a convenient excuse to do so.

###### Dorzinuuth the Base

To those who know the Dragon Phalanx of old, no name inspires more awe and fear than that of Dorzinuuth (dor-ZIN-yew-uth). A mastermind on the battlefield and the foundation of the dragon knights' fraternity, Dorzinuuth was known for mounting daring campaigns and always returning with the same number of soldiers and often alongside new recruits. In the wake of the death of Good King Omund, many were shocked to see Dorzinuuth debase himself with banditry and petty mercenary jobs. Others hold on to the hope that he makes unknown moves in darkness, waiting for the day when he can again uphold his oath in the light.

###### Draconian Languages

Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax. Aeolyxria speaks Caelian and the First Language. Locratix speaks Caelian and Oaxuatl. Myxovidan speaks Caelian and Axiomatic.

###### Draconian Malice

At the start of any draconian's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Guarding Gale (3 Malice)**

## Dragons

"John, you don't have to do this."

Sir John ignored his draconian friend.

"Maybe ditch the arms and armor," Bootblack said.

"Nah, I thought of that." John looked down at his gear. "This is who I am. I go in there under some... some *pretense* and I might foul the whole thing up." He shook his head. "Just another kind of trick."

He turned to Embers. "Any luck?" he asked.

Ember's eyes, currently solid starscape, faded into her normal, goldflecked azure eyes. "Yes," she said, and some tension fled from the group. "Choryvixiar, the Forge of Pain."

"Oh, wonderful," Jackson Bootblack said while the rest of the team groaned.

Embers recalled her void vision. "I know this dragon," she said and closed her eyes. "Wings like sword blades. Choryvixiar razed a dwarven city, the city of Kal Aethyrion."

Dazar gave John a look. "John, Kal Aethyrion was sacked twelve thousand years ago," he said.

"It wanted the legendary armory of Zor, the Metalmaster of Aethyrion. They treated with it. It allowed them to evacuate the city first." Embers opened her eyes and looked at John. "It can be reasoned with," she said, and nodded.

"I think it'll work," John said.

Vaantikalisax put a hand on the pommel of his mace. "*Why?*" he demanded.

"I'll tell you why," Jackson said. Everyone looked at the polder. "Well, we all know it's in there, right?" Jackson asked, gesturing to the cave. They nodded.

"Then it... or he, I guess, knows we're out here. And he hasn't roasted us, so... maybe he's waiting to hear our offer?"

John smiled at the troubadour having come to the same conclusion he had. He turned to Embers. "A crucible dragon?" She nodded. He sighed.

"The crucibles make fortresses of iron. Steel. And they burn with eternal heat," Dazar said, the second most qualified loremaster among them. "This is just a cave," he said.

Gwillyv appeared with what looked like a metal roof shingle. She passed it to A Mist Curls Around Dying Embers. You could see how heavy it was by the way she held it.

"Yes," Embers said, looking at the metal dragonscale made of blackened iron. She pressed her palm against it. Metal scored over centuries and impregnated with ancient soot. "This creature had a home recently, such as you describe, theochron. But something happened and it was forced to flee. Wounded, probably. This would have been years ago, and it slumbered here since. Then something woke it."

She turned the heavy, metal scale over in her hands. "When a dragon gets this old, all it knows is pain. It becomes hateful, *spiteful*."

"Yeah, I had a bad toothache once, it was a bitch, I know how it feels," Bootblack said. Everyone ignored him.

"There has to be some other option," Sir Vaantikalisax said.

"Well, I talked to Ffyllynvir or however you pronounce it," John said. "The Thorns are at an impasse. They can't pull back without exposing whole villages to this thing, and they can't bring it down."

"So we fight!" Dazar said and gripped his staff in a battle stance. John shrugged. "They tried that," he said. "If the Thorns couldn't take this thing down I doubt we could. Time to try something else."

Dazar came to inspect the dragonscale. Vaantikalisax grabbed John by the arm. "John, do you know what you're doing?" he said under his breath. Others had asked essentially the same question, but this was Vaant.

John smiled at his friend. "Yeah." He looked at the group arguing about the wisdom of his plan and gestured with his head toward a boulder before walking away from the group. Vaant followed. When they were out of earshot, John explained his plan.

"Look. I don't believe in coincidences, okay? We need the Thorns, at the keep, when Saxton shows up. So what happens? They're tied up with this dragon. Well that's pretty nice for Saxton, isn't it?" He left it at that. Waited for Vaant to catch up.

Vaant looked around. It took him a second. Then he looked at John. "You think Saxton got here before us."

"Yes, I do," John said. "I told you I talked to Ffyllynvir, right? Do you know what they said?" John paused for a moment and his eyes unfocused as he remembered what Embers said the dragon's name was. "Choryvixiar," he said, suddenly coming back to reality, "started this vendetta against the wode elves a *week* after Saxton came to power. And *I* think? It might have been *less* than a week."

"Ah," Vaant said, impressed. "And you don't believe in coincidences."

"If Embers is right, this dragon might be the most dangerous thing, of any kind, in the entire duchy. If *I* were Saxton? Getting that thing on my side would be my first priority."

"Because if it works," Vaant said, "you start your campaign with a powerful ally. And if it doesn't..."

"Then he starts with a powerful enemy. So, first thing he does is find out whose side the dragon's on."

"Because that dictates his entire strategy." Vaant was impressed and more impressed because he'd known John for years and was still surprised. "Well done, John." Vaant acted like the dragon was already on their side.

"Everyone thinks this is some big risk, some daring ploy," John was looking at the rest of the team. He shook his head, then looked back at Vaant. "But if Saxton did it, if *he* talked to this thing? *I* can. And I'm a better negotiator."

"Because you're not an... an 'unrepentant...'" He couldn't remember what the polder, Jackson Bootblack, had called Lord Saxton earlier.

"Cockbag," John finished for him. "I'm not an unrepentant cockbag, yeah, that's the idea."

"Smart," Vaant said and shook John's hand. "Good luck."

"Hey!" Jackson Bootblack said. John turned to look at him. "Saxton's armor is made from the whispering iron," he said. "It's only found in Hell. Pretty good prize for a dragon with taste who turned out to be on the right side. Or *no* side."

John looked from the polder to the others. "Is that true or did you make it up?"

"I'll tell you after you come out." Bootblack smiled. "*If* you come out." John shook his head with amused exasperation. Bootblack spread his hands and bowed deeply.

Sir John proceeded toward the cave.

"John," Embers said. John sighed and stopped. "Flatter him," the void mage said. "Appeal to his vanity. Remind him that he's the most powerful thing in all Omund's Land."

"I got it," John said and filed the information away. He didn't really know what he was going to say. He was going to present himself and see what happened.

"And if you're wrong?" Gwylliv whispered. John could barely hear her, but he could guess what she said.

John shrugged with one shoulder. "If I'm wrong, we're all going to die anyway. No point living in fear. Anyone else?" No one said anything. Only Vaant and Embers could look him in the eye.

"Wish me luck," Sir John said, and walked alone into the dragon's lair.

### On Dragons

Terrifying behemoths. Harbingers of destruction and woe. Dragons claim the world for themselves, throw the innocent into despair, and inspire heroes to draw steel.

#### Where the Elements Meet Anguish

As elementals are pure expressions of the mundane world, their shapes can become hardened and bent by intense energies permeating that world. Over time, an elemental entangled in extreme concentrations of rancor or grief might crystallize into a terrifying creature known as a dragon.

Dragons are both a provocateur and a consequence of people's anguish. A thorn dragon will cover crops and forests in a fortress of bramble vines and threaten to starve the people living there, yet they were born out of decades of hunger and strife that came before them. Vanquishing a dragon might be necessary to save innocent lives, but unless the underlying problems are addressed, another dragon will take their place in time.

#### Draco Vulgaris

Many regular dragons share a number of commonalities between them, such as powerful wings, whiplike tails, and reptilian faces adorned with horns. People categorize dragons more specifically based on where they're found and how those environments have shaped their forms, such as the gloom dragon having a telltale mantle of fog. Some individual dragons retain a trait or two from their primordial forms, while more powerful dragons have been known to intentionally change their shapes to distinguish themselves even further.

Across all dragons, their breath is their most violent form of self-expression. Whether they roar to ward off threats or charge their breath with elemental energy, no good comes from a dragon opening their mouth.

#### Wyrmscale

Most dragons are covered in wyrmscale, a hardy plate that both absorbs and emits elemental energy. Wyrmscale not only protects dragons, but allows them to catalyze their bodies and further shape their environment. The crucible dragon, for example, erupts with blasts of steam that let them take to the air and rain down death upon their foes.

When a dragon feels threatened, their wyrmscale radiates massive amounts of energy and creates a barrier around them. This barrier buffers both incoming and outgoing force, allowing the dragon to become even more fearsome should their defenses break down.

#### Lords of Their Domains

It is said that a dragon's physical form includes the land they're found in. The longer a dragon spends time in a location, the more control they have over it. In an omen dragon's domain, for instance, the land becomes barren as old souls become suspended in its thickened air, with new life unable to breach the soil.

This impact is more than a passive consequence of a dragon's presence, for dragons use their magic to set seals upon creatures and lands they claim as their own. To be "dragonsealed" in this way is to become an extension of the dragon's might and subject to their fury.

Folk in cultures that have developed in close proximity to a dragon might give alms to a dragon as if they were a saint, and treat the dragon's seal as a blessing. There is some value to this, for few other predators are foolish enough to encroach on a dragon's territory.

#### Dragon Hoards

Legendary heroes protect the common folk from dragons. Foolhardy adventurers brave a dragon's lair to take their treasure.

Mature dragons hoard vast amounts of treasure and wealth as a hunting technique. The more valuable their trove, the more prey they lure into their clutches. Desperate kings have sent whole armies to their deaths for the opportunity to expand a kingdom's wealth. Their efforts only expand a dragon's hoard, though, as weapons, armor, and magic trinkets add to the wealth that can't be ignored.

Younger dragons still settling their domains have been known to scour ruins and ancient cities for treasures to start their hoard. It is not unheard of for a dragon to either repeatedly visit or settle near people who willingly give them their valuables and heirlooms.

<!-- -->
> **What's In A Hoard?**
>
> It's said that the only creature greedier than a dragon is a dragon hunter. Dragons know this all too well, and their lairs are accordingly well-hidden and guarded. Even if would-be thieves stumble upon an absent dragon's hoard, their troubles are only beginning: some dragons magically know the locations of every treasure purloined from their hoard, while others maintain discreet contacts with local fences and dealers in rare goods.

#### Draco Nobilis

Regular dragons should not be confused with the elder dragons, otherwise known as true dragons. These legendary beings are said to be able to devour entire worlds. Even the most fearsome meteor dragon possesses only a modicum of a true dragon's power and wiles.

(The draco nobilis will be explored in future adventures and products.)

### Thorn Dragon

Thorn dragons take root in the destitution of nature, and are cultivated by the suffering of those who struggle against the cruelty of drought, fire, flood, and more. Though a region's people might have long overcome past famine, the desperation of those who suffered long before has already nurtured their future scourge.

These dragons appear born of the wood, resembling living thickets bedecked in torturous thorns. With twisting briar horns and wings shaped by tangled roots, thorn dragons embody the richness of nature they so readily leech the life from.

#### Conquerors of the Green

Thorn dragons cultivate their lairs in lush farmlands or flourishing forests. They engulf these beautiful regions in massive briar thickets, choking out existing flora until their own brambles are the only things that grow. In forests, this process drives out local fauna smart enough to flee rather than foolishly fight against the wood's new ruler. When a thorn dragon establishes their lair over a village's farmlands, local folk either wisely relocate or slowly starve for the sake of stubborn pride.

#### Natural Curators

More intelligent dragons seek all forms of riches for their hoard, but thorn dragons have no eye for worldly treasures. Instead, they amass the wealth of the wild they represent. Thorn dragons stockpile food even food they won't eat-alongside uncut gemstones, minerals and ore, wood, oils, and spices.

#### Bestial Instincts

Compared to more powerful dragons, thorn dragons are closer to beasts in temperament. They are incapable of speech and act primarily on instinct as they expand their territories, defend their lairs, and grow their hoards.

Despite this, the folk of certain settlements manage to avoid being driven from their homes or starved at the expense of being dependent on a thorn dragon's bestial ego. These farmers and woods folk come to a tenuous understanding with the dragon, trading them the kinds of treasure they desire in exchange for meager foodstuffs from the dragon's hoard.

#### Territorial Brutes

Thorn dragons are highly territorial, and are vigilant against potential threats to their lairs. To defend their homes, these dragons take advantage of their thickets by dragonsealing intruders, pushing and pulling them across the briars, and letting the thorns bleed them dry. When mere brambles aren't enough, thorn dragons either imbue those brambles' barbs with poison or breathe out those toxins directly, taking pleasure in slowly draining the life from their enemies.

<!-- -->

### Gloom Dragon

Where twilight spills long and cold over the lands and chilling fog hangs heavy and wet through long autumns and winters, there you will find gloom dragons. Wreathed in churning shadows and wrapped in glittering dark scales, gloom dragons bring with them heavy fog and mist that manifests hallucinations, trapping their prey in nightmares.

#### Thrill of the Hunt

While many dragons command grand enclosed spaces, gloom dragons make their lairs within sprawling, murky wilds, commanding vast territories. As clever as ravens and as cunning as hunting beasts, they use mimicry and hallucinations to draw unsuspecting travelers ever farther into the mists of their domain, until the fog swallows the sound of those travelers' screams.

In areas where gloom dragons settle, people are known to have more nightmares than usual.

#### Intangible Treasures

Gloom dragons are eerie collectors of voices, memories, and nightmares, as well as material items. Though able to speak, they can only repeat exactly what they've already heard, and so they prize their vast collections of voices and phrases, using these sounds to lure mortals close enough to draw out their memories and fears. Endlessly curious and fascinated by terror, gloom dragons are keen to see what hallucinations terrorize their prey before they slaughter them.

When a gloom dragon slays a victim, they take not just their valuables, but also whatever is most meaningful to their fears. A broken mirror from a dead lover will always fascinate a gloom dragon more than a perfect ruby brooch.

#### Unnerving Neighbors

Instinct and curiosity drive these enshrouded hunters. It is rare to find a gloom dragon who can be reasoned with, but some might develop an understanding with nearby settlements, such that each leaves the other to their business. Since gloom dragons focus on individual terrorizing over mass destruction, it is relatively easy to coexist with one lurking in the swamps nearby. But in such cases, these dragons become the subject of stories told to children, warning them to never follow voices into the fog.

#### Gloom Dragon Languages

Eerie myths surround the gloom dragons, for they wield languages they do not themselves speak. These draconic nightmares can mimic any sound they've heard. But more mysteriously, the magic that produces their hallucinations also mimics the sounds a foe's mind produces, no matter their language. If a hero hallucinates a loved one dying, everyone around will hear that loved one's screams for help.

<!-- -->
> **Gloom Dragon's Domain**
>
> If the encounter map is a location the dragon has occupied for 1 week or more, illusory magic suffuses the location with shadowy malevolence. Each creature on the encounter map other than the dragon takes a −2 penalty to saving throws made to end the frightened condition. Additionally, whenever a frightened enemy on the encounter map takes damage, they take an extra 3 psychic damage.

### Crucible Dragon

Crucible dragons are born from metallic elementals touched by the toxic combination of fiery rage and ice-cold grief-often the result of failure in the pursuit of perfection. Each dragon is a dark forge of abandoned creativity melted down in fires of spite, jealousy, and hate.

These metallic dragons are massive, heavy creatures requiring an immense release of heat to engage in flight. Their scales range from gleaming silver to blackened iron, depending on how fastidious they are about cleaning, and are occasionally gilded with more-precious metals. Their long tails terminate with a massive, hammer-like tip that can freeze over and instantly cool hot metal.

#### Bastions of Steel

Crucible dragons make their homes high in the mountains, most commonly in peaks cut through with thick veins of iron ore. Occasionally, one will take over a fortress or outpost, but wherever they settle, the first thing a crucible dragon sets in place is a colossal anvil. From there, the dragon consumes vast amounts of iron, slagging that iron in their belly to create a fortress of steel around them. Much of the slag is expelled into heated vats for forging, but a dragon keeps a small reserve inside their gut in case they need to melt any intrusive adventurers.

#### Discerning Collectors

Crucible dragons are obsessive collectors, and have a habit of narrowly focusing on a singular creation when it comes to collection and replication. Bynirak, the Rain of Ten Thousand Spears, is known to collect only the most finely crafted and powerful magic polearms in Vasloria. Joris'nyrathi, the Scorching Aegis, is said to have a collection of shields that would rival any god of the forge.

All crucible dragons manage to accrue large amounts of armaments and armor in their hoards. They care little for gems and gold, other than for melting down as filigree or embossing the weapons and armor they forge.

#### Flawed Pursuits

The failure that spawned a crucible dragon drives their obsessive pursuits. They endlessly attempt to reproduce the perfect treasures they count among their most prized possessions, but can only recreate flawed copies at a fraction of their original power. Discarded projects, melted heaps of raw iron, and scrap angrily embedded into cavern walls perpetually surround a crucible dragon as examples of their failures, perpetuating a cycle of obsessive rage, grief, and inescapable decline.

#### Crucible Dragon Languages

The oldest of crucible dragons are known to speak some Vastariax, though younger dragons are typically silent. However, survivors of an encounter with a younger crucible dragon sometimes report the monster using the Caelian phrases "not enough" and "mine."

<!-- -->
> **Crucible Dragon's Domain**
>
> If the encounter map is a location the dragon has occupied for 1 week or more, melted metal and blades coat nearly every surface. Any creature other than the dragon who starts their turn in physical contact with a surface on the encounter map takes 5 damage. Such creatures take an additional 5 damage when they take damage from being force moved into a surface on the map. Whenever an enemy in the encounter uses an ability that deals lightning damage, they take 1d6 damage to themself and each enemy and object adjacent to them.

### Omen Dragon

They have been known by many names: Reaper, Blight, Sorrow, Stillness, Vengeance, Grief. The omen dragons carry as many meanings and interpretations as death itself-for they are death embodied. This dragon is a coalescing of wayward souls, the stench of death solidified, that clings to the last vestiges of this world-to the detriment of their surroundings.

#### Life and Death

The opposite of life isn't death-it's stagnation. When a soul refuses to move on, it lives outside the cycle of life. Souls can have any number of reasons to linger: anger, fear, sadness, a thirst for revenge. One skilled at dealing with the undead might even be able to shepherd such a soul back into its cycle. But when hundreds of souls with hundreds of unique motivations bind themselves to an elemental and form an omen dragon, the only practical way to stop them is to destroy what they've become.

As the embodiment of these wayward souls, the omen dragon wields them like weapons. They can send restless souls to grab creatures and pull them in, or to possess their attackers, compelling them to distraction in the middle of a fight. They even wrap themselves in the most durable of souls, creating a stifling aura.

#### Life Outside Life

Just as the omen dragon exists outside the cycle of life, so too does their domain. The omen dragon's dragonseal brings desolation and stagnancy to all living things. Growth does not happen. Living things that grow or creatures who dwell near an omen dragon's domain do not age. One can often find secret societies researching lichdom residing in

such sites, for what better place to study than a stagnant wasteland that grants one infinite time?

The effects that surround an omen dragon also mean that new life cannot begin. Civilization cannot exist, let alone prosper, without a reliable food source. When living creatures die in these dragons' domains, their bodies do not decompose. Their souls are sucked into the omen dragon, granting the creature ever more power.

#### Wicked Visions

To face off against an omen dragon is to stare down death itself. One can spend only so long near a choir of restless souls before being compelled to sing. For the sin of defiance, this dragon bestows upon their attackers an omen of their own death. Tarry too long near the creature, and a hero risks fulfilling that prophecy, even if they can weather the dragon's unrelenting attacks.

#### Omen Dragon Languages

An omen dragon speaks with the voices of all the souls they have collected. In addition to Vastariax, the dragon speaks and understands whatever languages those souls knew in life.

<!-- -->
> **Omen Dragon's Domain**
>
> If the encounter map is a location the dragon has occupied for 1 week or more, any creature on the map who regains Stamina regains only half the expected amount. Additionally, when a creature on the map who has a soul dies, the dragon absorbs the soul, granting the Director 1 Malice. The creature can't be brought back to life until the dragon is destroyed.

If multiple Deathcounts are imposed on a creature, they don't stack. Only the lowest Deathcount takes effect. All Deathcounts are lost when the dragon is reduced to 0 Stamina.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Stagnant Wyrmscale Aura**
>
> The dragon's scales create a 4 aura of supernatural stagnancy around them. The area is difficult terrain for enemies, and no creature except the omen dragon can regain Stamina while in the area.

### Meteor Dragon

They dwell in the cold, airless depths of space in lair-cities built of stolen kingdoms for centuries at a time. Then without warning or mercy, a meteor dragon attacks.

#### Kingdom Killers

A meteor dragon's territory is hard to define. Their attacks might come ages apart, and not every dead civilization or ruined city is the work of a dragon. But when a city grows too great, an empire too powerful, or a culture too advanced, the meteor dragon descends. Their violence isn't mindless or wanton, but cold and calculated. Often, they breach dams, trigger landslides, and devastate granaries and fields, knowing that the chaos and devastation they unleash will continue long after they return to their lairs.

#### Cities in the Sky

Other dragons hoard trinkets and baubles. Meteor dragons claim their domain over infrastructure. Palaces, fortresses, monuments, and towers are often stolen by these creatures and brought back to their spacefaring lairs, arranged into dilapidated tableaus of the places they have obliterated. A meteor dragon's floating lair-city is both their hoard and home, fused together and secured by the dragon's glittering crystal dragonseal. Within this labyrinthine jumble of ruination, a meteor dragon lurks in wait for the next civilization to grow too comfortable.

#### Avatar of the Infinite

Meteor dragons have an innate mastery over gravitational forces that allows them to crush enemies and buildings on a whim. They're among the smallest of the dragons, but the density of their bodies exudes an intense field of the cold, airless void of space around them wherever they go.

A meteor dragon's body is infused with crystalline starlight, which they can convert to a barrage of white-hot energy rays. At any distance, the dragon's presence can forever sear the minds of lesser creatures.

#### Voidlight Annihilation

Voidlight is the name given to the unique energy produced by the breath of a meteor dragon. It is anathema to existence, an evil energy that destroys all. Anything that exists, no matter its material, strength, or potency, is inverted and ceases to exist when bathed in voidlight.

#### Meteor Dragon Languages

Meteor dragons are not known for their conversational habits. When they do deign to speak, it is exclusively in Vastariax and the First Language.

<!-- -->
> **Meteor Dragon's Domain**
>
> If the encounter map is a location the dragon has occupied for 1 week or more, each creature other than the dragon has their stability reduced to 0 and automatically obtains a tier 1 outcome on Agility tests.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Liftoff (3 Malice)**

Each creature who has M < 5 and each object of size 3 or smaller is vertical pulled 2 squares toward the area at the start of each round, ignoring stability. Any creature who starts their turn in the area or any object in the area at the end of the round suffers the effect of the dragon's Voidlight Breath ability, and the black hole disappears.

## Dwarves

Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone-a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves.

They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is "Ord made the world." Their way of saying, "What will be, will be." Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord's name.

### Tools of the Trade

Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power.

Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it's a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.

### Innovative Operation

The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors' greatest achievement, but they've made great strides in researching them. They've innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator.

Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises.

Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.

### The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar

Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe.

But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax's rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax's favor. Most dwarves don't like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work.

The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.

### Servitor War Walkers

The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they're used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.

### Stone Whisperers

Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy's crushing defeat.

Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today's stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.

### Dwarf Languages

Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.

###### Dwarf Malice

## Elementals

When the gods formed the mundane world, they took sparks of creation from the roiling plane of Quintessence and gave sentience to some of the multiverse's most basic elements-air, earth, fire, and water. Many elementals contain just one of these components, but can come to embody multiple reagents as they age.

#### Duality of Form

Elementals are mercurial creatures of creation, destruction, and transformation. Though the deities first created the mundane world, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn't suit an elemental, they break it down with elemental fury then build it anew.

Elementals change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are protectors armored by stone, lizards ablaze with fire, and sometimes dragons clad in steel.

#### Rebirth and Reformation

When an elemental dies in the mundane world, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain their strength. Should the spirit return to the mundane world, they take on a form that reflects a creature or other aspect of that plane.

#### Crux of Fire

Cruxes of fire, often called blazecasters, take the form of fiery lizards. They commonly live in hot zones of planar convergence or areas of volcanic activity. These territorial elementals usually question interlopers from afar-and if they don't like the answers, they rain down fire before their foes can draw near.

Though many elementals weave their innate gifts into oral storytelling, cruxes of fire are particularly adroit at animating their stories in silhouettes of flame.

#### Essence of Storms

At a distance, most would mistake an essence of storms, sometimes known as a galeweaver, for a large bird of prey. This majestic creature is formed from streaks of colored cloud stuff woven into the silhouette of a large eagle or falcon.

Galeweavers act as scouts for their handlers or for groups of elementals, and they're usually the first to spot trouble. Insatiably curious, an essence of storms often swoops down to talk when they observe travelers.

#### Essence of Tides

An essence of tides looks like a shimmering blue manta ray that glides over land as easily as through water, earning them the common name of tidedrifter. Most common along coastlines, essences of tides enjoy harmless pranks, especially against folk who regularly sail or swim in their waters.

Tidedrifters have a healthy sense of humor that makes it easy to win their friendship-but their relaxed demeanor evaporates if friends or family face threats.

#### Field of Growth

The field of growth takes the form of a massive centipede made of vegetation. Often called verdant primevals, these caretakers of the natural cycle of life (and death) fight those they see as upsetting that cycle. Fields of growth seek not only to destroy undead and those who create them, but to sabotage divine servitors who casually peddle resurrection magic.

#### Force of Earth

A protective earth elemental, a force of earth resembles a nine-foot-tall great ape formed of dirt and rough stone. They act as guardians and historians when among other elementals, working tirelessly to thwart ills from befalling the group. These elementals are sometimes called earthen bulwarks.

#### Elemental Languages

Most elementals speak Low Kuric. Some can use Caelian when they need to.

###### Elemental Malice

At the start of any elemental's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Elemental Swap (3 Malice)**
>
> Two elementals on the encounter map teleport to swap places, and each has damage immunity 2 until the end of the round.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Split (5 Malice)**
>
> An elemental acting this turn cleaves themself into two separate elementals. Each elemental has the same statistics as the original, except that each has half the original's current Stamina and is one size smaller. Both elementals can then shift up to their speed.

>
> **Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, the target has a +5 bonus to speed and a +5 damage bonus to strikes. Additionally, whenever an elemental within the target's line of effect uses an ability with "Convocation" in the name, the target also gains the effects of that ability.

## Elves, High

The children of the solar celestials, the high elves were created to tend to the sun elves as librarians and heralds. Now they sequester themselves away from the world amid the fallen cities of the sky elves, remembering a better age, before the arrival of humans and war to the world made the high elves who they are today.

#### Glamorous

The high elves hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on physical features and aspects of personality as they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one's own values and fascinations.

#### Loremasters

The adage "knowledge is power" is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is "knowledge before power." High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy.

In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.

#### Elemental Summoners

Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances.

Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.

#### Surround and Suppress

Foes who threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. High elves take advantage of each other's magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. The more exposure a victim has to high elf magic, the more effective that magic is in destroying them. High elf wyrds ensure there's no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits-and eventually, graveyards.

#### Magical Manipulation

The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison.

Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.

#### The Unseen Hands

The Unseen Hands is a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall at the hands of the sun elves. The story surrounding their purported discoveries has twisted into a narrative decrying modern society for benefiting from the lore accumulated in service to the sun elves. The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles as they attempt to dismantle that society and plunge the world into anarchy.

#### The Ordinator

Being in the presence of a high elf ordinator inspires an ancient fear in those who know high elf history. Occupying a position of both military and clerical authority, an ordinator is capable of focusing a force of high elves to precisely strike an arrow's tip from the other end of the battlefield. These spellcasters are among the most studied elves in their communities and courts, and their strategic minds are matched only by their affinity with elementals. The ordinator is not only an illuminating beacon of command for their platoon; they are a spiritual beacon of hope for their people.

#### High Elf Languages

Most high elves speak Caelian and Hyrallic, with some also speaking Yllyric.

<!-- -->
> **The Ordinator is a Magic Beacon**
>
> Whenever a high elf ordinator appears on an encounter map, the Chaincast Malice feature is improved and always active. When any elf uses a magic ability as if they were in the ordinator's space, that ability has a double edge.

###### High Elf Malice

At the start of any high elf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Chaincast (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, whenever a high elf uses a magic ability, they can use it as if they were occupying the square of another high elf on the encounter map to whom they have line of effect.

> **High Elf Deployments**

> High elves are obsessed with knowledge: discovering it, documenting it, and protecting it. While this means that many of them are cloistered in towers with noses buried firmly in ancient tomes, lost knowledge is often found in dangerous ruins or in the collections of powerful individuals with no intent to share. When this happens, strike teams of like- minded high elves deploy to infiltrate and "forcefully acquire" such knowledge.
>
> Many high elves also consider themselves guardians of dangerous or forbidden lore and are ready to defend it with their lives. Many illusory groves and glamoured ruins conceal repositories and powerful warriors sworn to keep these secrets out of the hands of those who would use them for ill.

## Elves, Shadow

Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.

Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden's topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all.

#### In Equinox's Shadow

Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold's eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.

#### Manifold Weaponry

The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.

#### Brush Stalkers

When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers-quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves.

A brush stalker's glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.

#### Fractured Factions

Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.

#### Duskcalling

Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.

A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.

#### Shadow Tactics

Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they'll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can't benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.

In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children's game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.

#### Shadow Elf Languages

Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.

###### Shadow Elf Malice

At the start of any shadow elf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Watch Me Disappear (3 Malice)**
>
> Each shadow elf acting this turn can attempt to hide as a free maneuver if they have concealment.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Extra Dimension (5 Malice)**
>
> When any shadow elf acting this turn makes a strike against a target who has I < 2 in addition to the strike's regular effects, the target is bleeding (save ends) or slowed (save ends).

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Home Is Where the Hurt Is (10 Malice)**
>
> The shadow elves synthesize a concentrated pocket manifold reminiscent of Equinox and graft it onto the encounter map. Until the end of the encounter, all creatures can see shadow elves in full color, and shadow elves no longer benefit from their Of the Umbra trait. Additionally, the potency of all shadow elf abilities increases by 2, and any enemy making a saving throw against an effect imposed by a shadow elf ability must roll an 8 or higher as they feel the effect across two worlds.

###### Shadow Elf Deployments

When under order of the Shadow Queen, shadow elf missions outside of Equinox are usually short, dangerous, and targeted. They rarely last more than a week or two, and the force often appears in Orden not far from their target. Mission goals trend towards the nefarious-kidnapping, assassination, theft, and general skullduggery are the order of the day.

No matter their affiliation , these groups will brook no attempts to thwart their goals and are all deadly warriors.

## Elves, Wode

Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans *should* fear the trees.

Wode elves' natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.

#### Heart of the Wode

The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode's beating heart.

#### Wodeworking

Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg's rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.

Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.

#### Sylvan Surveillance

The wode elves' natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest's goings-on while inside it. This isn't a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf's understanding of their surroundings.

A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.

#### Blightless Ambition

Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home's boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest's edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.

#### Chirurgeons

When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (*kai-RUR-jinz*) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.

#### Warleader

The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy's movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader's role is primarily that of teacher-a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.

The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.

#### Wode Elf Languages

Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.

one of the following features.

###### Wode Elf Malice

At the start of any wode elf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Forest Network (3 Malice)**
>
> Each wode elf who ends this turn hidden can shift up to their speed while remaining hidden.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Punishing Regrowth (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, each wode elf gains an edge on abilities, and their strikes can slide a target up to 2 squares in addition to their usual effects. If a strike already imposes forced movement, this slide happens after that forced movement. A creature force moved by a wode elf's strike who ends this forced movement in difficult terrain is restrained until the end of their next turn.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Vines Everywhere (7 Malice)**
>
> Vines rapidly grow across the entire encounter map. Each enemy in the encounter makes an **Agility test**.

- **≤11:** 8 damage; restrained (save ends)
- **12-16:** Restrained (EoT)
- **17+:** No effect.

###### Wode Elf Tactics

Wode elves are at their most powerful in dense and vertical battlefields and tend to bait attackers into disadvantageous fights with false retreats and hidden reinforcements. Not only does this allow them to make full use of their proficiency in concealment and cover but also lets them utilize their climbing skills to gain height advantages. While they prefer taking fights into the deep woods, the elves settle for urban or mountainous areas if the only other option is a wide-open space.

Wode elves are highly mobile and adept at hindering their enemies. A common tactic is to unleash their panoply of slowing and restraining abilities on melee-oriented opponents while harassing ranged combatants with teleports and surprise attacks from off-angles.

**Wode Elf Sample Encounters**

- **Scout Patrol, 23 EV:** Four lookouts, eight scouts, one chirurgeon, one green seer
- **Blightless Militia, 32 EV:** Eight yeomen, eight runners, one druid, one greenskeeper, one sentry
- **Hawkeye Cavalry, 48 EV:** Three gweiadur, three wodenelg Reclaimer Force, 74 EV: Sixteen yeomen, sixteen scouts, one guerrilla, one druid, two greenskeepers, one warleader

## Fossil Cryptic

The cave-diving humans who first found fossil cryptics initially thought they were the fossilized reanimated skeletons of creatures predating recorded history. When the explorers' priest presented a holy symbol and attempted to turn the cryptics, he learned these fossilized bones aren't mindless undead-and seconds later, he wound up crushed to death by a pillar of stone.

#### Primal Sentries

In truth, these living fossil amalgamations are inhabited by elemental spirits. Fossil cryptics are found in places of otherworldly beauty with a connection to an elemental plane of Quintessence, often in caves that have remained untouched for eons or whose tunnels are laced with veins of priceless metal in exquisite fractal patterns. Elemental spirits from that plane inhabit the fossils of creatures who once protected the site, carrying on their legacy. Archaeologists, miners, and others who disturb a cryptic's domain are ground into dust and subsumed into the creature's own form.

#### Bones of the Earth

Though fossil cryptics vary wildly in their chosen shape and form, all contain a central cluster of fossils atop a churning column of rock and metal. With malleable limbs extending from their earthy core, cryptics move with unsettling speed.

#### Ancient Intelligence

Fossil cryptics often warn trespassers to leave their domains, speaking threats in ancient languages before attacking. Should trespassers persist, cryptics weaponize columns of stone at range and can manipulate the ground around them, pushing and pulling friend and foe alike into the best positions for battle.

#### Fossil Cryptic Languages

Many fossil cryptics speak Phorialtic, but they are known to also use the ancient languages of the ruins they inhabit.

###### Fossil Cryptic Malice

At the start of a fossil cryptic's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🏹 **Floor Mosaic (3 Malice)**
>
> The fossil cryptic slides one creature on the ground up to 5 squares. If the creature is prone, this forced movement ignores stability.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The fossil cryptic takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Stone Pillars (5 Malice)**
>
> Two pillars of stone 1 square wide either thrust up out of the ground or jut down from the ceiling anywhere on the encounter map, to a height of up to 5 squares. A creature in the area of a pillar before it appears is knocked prone on its surface. If the creature comes into contact with the ceiling above or the floor beneath the pillar and has M < 2 they are restrained (save ends).

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Choking Dust (10 Malice)**
>
> The air across the encounter map is thick with dust until the end of the encounter. Each enemy in the dust is suffocating. Additionally, at the end of each round, each enemy in the dust makes a **Might test**.
>
> - **≤11:** Until the end of the enemy's next turn, their stability is reduced to 0, and any forced movement effects targeting them gain a +2 bonus to the distance moved.
> - **12-16:** The enemy's stability is halved (EoT).
> - **17+:** No effect.

## Giants

Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few "smallfolk" structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.

#### Adaptable and Elemental

Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn't simply live on a glacial mountain-they're part of that mountain, and it's part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, "Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?"

#### Distant Cousins

Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don't view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they're willing to be in the vanguard.

#### Fire Giants

Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding.

Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.

#### Frost Giants

Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory.

Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as *issenblau* in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.

#### Hill Giants

Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes.

Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant's ire, making them switch from one target to another.

#### Stone Giants

Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity.

Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes-sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.

#### Giant Languages

Most giants speak their kind's dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.

###### Giant Malice

At the start of any giant's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

## Gnolls

Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll's muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack's eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.

#### Born From Blood

The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas-bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As'sylrak the Warper.

As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends "gnoll," an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is "to consume completely." And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.

#### Ceaseless Hunger

The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn't receive As'sylrak's blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh-and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.

#### Gnoll War

Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren't choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.

#### Abyssal Hyenas

Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.

#### Tusker Demons

Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves-enemies and allies alike.

#### Gnoll Languages

Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac.

#### Heroes Beware!

When gnolls go into a frenzy and coordinate their individual Cackletongue maneuvers, few heroes will leave the battlefield unscarred. Any 1st-echelon encounter that contains more than two non-minion gnolls can be considered one difficulty category harder at the Director's discretion.

###### Gnoll Malice

At the start of any gnoll's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Iron Jaws (3 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Ranged, Weapon** |   **Maneuver** |
> | ------------------------ | -------------: |
> | **📏 1 cube within 3**   | **🎯 Special** |

>
> - **≤11:** 6 damage; bleeding (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; bleeding (EoT)
> - **17+:** No effect.
>
> **Effect:** While an enemy is bleeding this way, each gnoll in the encounter gains an edge on strikes made against them.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Bloodpool (5 Malice)**
>
> One gnoll minion suddenly explodes into a pool of blood, splattering the area within 3 squares of them. Any gnoll who starts their turn in this area deals an extra 5 damage on their next strike before the end of their turn. Once per round, an abyssal hyena who starts their turn in the area turns into a **gnoll marauder**, keeping their current Stamina.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Echoes of Laughter (7 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the encounter, the encounter map is encased in a soundscape of laughter and howling. Each enemy takes a bane on the first power roll they make each round. Whenever a gnoll is killed, this effect is suppressed until the start of the next round.

## Goblins

Known among themselves as *rogabrin*, meaning "more of us" in their Szetch language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoid species in the world. They can be found across many lands, have developed countless distinct cultures, and dare to venture into environments that few other humanoids are willing to hazard.

Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society-thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.

#### Encountered in Groups

Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident-perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger goblin hordes might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they're encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.

###### Goblin Malice

At the start of any goblin's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Goblin Mode (3 Malice)**
>
> Each goblin in the encounter gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the round.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Tiny Stabs (5 Malice)**
>
> Each enemy in the encounter takes 1 damage for each goblin adjacent to them.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Swamp Stink (7 Malice)**
>
> The encounter map is covered in a green mist that lasts until the end of the round, and which can't be dispersed by wind. All areas of the map are difficult terrain for non-goblins, and each non-goblin on the map makes a **Might test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 5 poison damage; the creature is weakened until the mist disappears.
> - **12-16:** The creature is weakened until the mist disappears.
> - **17+:** No effect.

#### Mobile and Sneaky

Short, lithe, and long armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies' knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.

#### Goblin Magic

Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.

#### Skitterling

A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.

#### War Spider

Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the animal's back. During a raid, a war spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.

#### Worg

Some goblins form a special bond with worgs-canine creatures raised by many goblin communities as mounts, guardians, and companions. A worg stays loyal to the hand that feeds them, and will protect their handler to the bitter end.

#### Goblin Languages

Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.

## Griffons

With the head, front legs, and wings of a bird and the powerful body and haunches of a feline, griffons are the apex predator's apex predator. Highly territorial with ranges spanning hundreds of leagues, these air-superiority hunters make quick work of any humanoids foolish enough to stumble into griffon lands.

#### Coveted Mounts

Attempting to capture a wild griffon typically ends in injury or worse, though humanoids who hatch griffons in captivity and raise them from birth find they make loyal companions. Some humanoid cultures raise griffons as mounts for the military or city guard, and griffon eggs can fetch a fine price.

Daring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by beak or talon. So great is the death toll that many localities have outlawed the poaching of griffon eggs.

#### Inaccessible Aeries

Griffons roost alone or in pairs on craggy mountainsides, in forests, or on cliffs overlooking the ocean. They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can't fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for three months starting in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then remain in or near the nest as their parents feed them. About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly-and after that, it's only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby.

#### Rare Breeds

Griffons come in many varieties. While the most common griffon is the leonine eagle, others include a falcon-panther variety, a bearded vulture-clouded leopard variety, and a striped condor griffon that combines the features of condor and tiger. Questions abound as to whether these creatures came about naturally or were fashioned by magic hands, and many scholars offer abundant rewards to adventurers who can bring them evidence of rare or undiscovered griffon types.

###### Griffon Malice

At the start of any griffon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

## Hag

When fear of death or hunger for power grips a mortal spellcaster, often a druid or a witch, they might forge a pact with an evil archfey. The mortal becomes a hag-aged, clawed, and cruel. A ruthlessly powerful fey in their own right, a hag uses their magic to bring about the misery their archfey wills.

#### Hiding in Plain Sight

Though hags typically appear as older humanoids, their true form is as vicious and nasty as their nature. They prefer to show the world a charitable face, but the general wisdom concerning hags is that the more beautiful their appearance, the deeper the rot within. This theory has never been confirmed, however, as few who see a hag's true form live to tell the tale.

#### Dealmakers and Heartbreakers

As old age can't kill them, the oldest hags accumulate swathes of knowledge, magic, and repute over time. They are happy to share their wares... for the right price. Rather than ask for paltry coin, a hag usually bargains for something dear to the customer-perhaps their ability to love, the sound of their child's laugh, or their left pinky toe.

Adding insult to injury, those who deal with hags almost always discover the product is worse than advertised. Mortals should pay close attention to the precise wording of their agreements, lest they end up with a hex they thought would be a gift. Such curses often lead to the corruption of good but desperate folk, with some getting so twisted up in fey deals that they become hags themselves.

#### What's in a Name?

Hags give themselves whimsical names, and older hags often select monikers such as Auntie, Uncle, or Nanny. Such relatable names help entice their favorite prey: the innocent. Who would fear Granny Gumdrops or Uncle Twothumbs?

#### Loyal Underlings

Hags are treacherous by nature, and they only recruit creatures they can trust to be loyal underlings. Most of these creatures lack sapience (such as animals, constructs, and undead), though hags sometimes command weaker fey who are too scared to betray them.

#### Hag Languages

Most hags speak Anjali, Caelian, Khelt, and Yllyric, with older hags often knowing several more languages.

#### Hag Malice

At the start of a hag's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

❇️ **Casting Curses and Bodies (3 Malice)**

The hag utters terrible words that push each enemy within 2 squares of them up to 3 squares.

## Hobgoblins

Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.

Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other's boundaries. This isn't normally a problem for other humanoids, but once or twice every generation, a wicked hobgoblin rallies their people and decides it's time to take over everyone else's lands-THEN it's a problem.

#### Synergized Tactics

Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.

#### Playing With Fire

The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat many other humanoids can't tolerate. They often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage also allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.

#### Innate Magic

Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or corruptive energy, while others can teleport across the battlefield or run like the fastest predators.

#### Binding Bargains

Many hobgoblins still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature-hobgoblin or otherwise-who degrades themself by breaking their word.

#### Grilp

The grilp-a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat-can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond the grilp's covert skills, however, hobgoblins value these creatures most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which weakens the defenses of other creatures.

#### Slaughter Demon

When evil hobgoblins who embrace their fiendish heritage need to wipe an enemy off the map, their war mages ritualistically beseech an archdevil for the service of a grack'tanar, known as a slaughter demon in the Caelian language. Once summoned, this towering, serpent-bodied, six-clawed demon slithers to war alongside the hobgoblins who summoned them.

Devils captured the grack'tanars eons ago. Broken, these demons wait for a call to war, hungry and frothing in the Seven Cities of Hell. Slaughter demons are eager to kill and please their devil captors so they might be sent out again, and they rarely turn on hobgoblins unless they fall into lethe (see the Demons section).

#### Hobgoblin Languages

Most hobgoblins speak Anjali, Caelian, and Szetch.

###### Hobgoblin Malice

At the start of any hobgoblin's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Goblin Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The hobgoblin activates a Malice Feature available to goblins.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Operation Goblin Mode (3 Malice)**
>
> Each goblin in the encounter gains a +3 bonus to speed until the end of the round.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Operation Tactical Swarm (5 Malice)**

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Operation Earth Sear (7 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, the ground throughout the encounter map becomes blazing hot. Any enemy takes 1 fire damage for each square of the ground they enter. Any enemy who ends their turn on the ground has fire weakness 2 until the start of their next turn.

## Humans

Humans flourish in every habitable part of the world, from inviting coastal cities to unforgiving mountainous terrain. While most humans live quietly in peaceful communities, some are drawn to adventure by an unquenchable thirst for excitement or power.

#### Villains and Heroes

Recognizing their limited lifespans, humans often set their eyes on immortality. They unfurl empires at the tip of a sword, sacrifice lives to erect grand monuments, and even aspire to godhood, all in hopes that their names will be remembered forever.

Violence and greed are close cousins in the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive for more with might or magic. Others turn to theft, sometimes driven to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons both seeking to exact a toll.

Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to call on. Cultists seek fell power in exchange for service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting apocalypse.

Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better. Human heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again, standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit of justice.

#### Risks and Rewards

Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive nature explains their renowned knack for seizing the moment-knowing when to risk all on a throw of the dice. Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their opponent's mistakes and seize the advantage.

Humans see unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an untamed forest transformed into a prosperous village, or an ancient dungeon yielding chests filled with coins. Pursuing such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these gamblers, it's a game worth playing.

#### Swords for Hire

With an appetite for warfare and gold, human adventurers are well represented in most mercenary bands. A human mercenary makes a stout ally... if you can afford their price.

#### Connected to the Natural World

Humans are connected to the natural world in a way that many other folk are not. As such, they have an uncanny knack for detecting when nearby creatures, objects, and phenomena have been created by magic and psionics. This same sense allows them to resist supernatural effects.

#### Human Languages

Most humans speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.

#### Human Malice

At the start of any human's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->

## Kingfissure Worm

Named for their infamous hunting technique, kingfissure worms terraform the earth as they move, building tunnels and crevasses to accommodate their enormous form. They then lie in wait deep underground. Seasoned adventurers know to be wary when traveling past even the smallest crack in the earth. For when a worm senses the vibrations of their prey above, they shoot their multiple serpentine tongues through the crevasses, dragging prey from the surface into their cavernous maw.

#### Intestine Inventory

The kingfissure worm eats indiscriminately, swallowing creatures, structures, and precious gems alike. The wealth inside a kingfissure worm would put any dragon's hoard to shame, though the worm cares nothing for treasure and knows nothing of the spoils lodged in their labyrinthine intestines. Few people have managed to claim the treasure lost to the inside of a kingfissure worm, but stories enough have spread to draw scavengers, bandits, and even armies to the corpses of recently slain worms, all hoping to come away with a king's ransom in spoils.

#### Home Renovators

Most worms build a den of tunnels and fissures, remaining in that lair for as long as the pickings on the surface are good and they aren't disturbed. When a kingfissure worm seeks a new home, they target areas with abundant food-occasionally leading to villagers waking up to find their surrounding lands have been terraformed overnight. Residents of such lands generally have two choices: pack up and leave or prepare for battle. If a worm is somehow defeated, all manner of creatures and communities try to lay claim to the worm's underground structures. These empty dens make wonderful war bunkers, isolated workshops, and even highly defensible villages.

#### Unstoppable Force

The kingfissure worm is a species determined to outrun, outlast, and out-eat every other living creature. Though the monster might be slowed by a display of great power, only death stops them. Once they have set their sights on their prey, they single-mindedly pursue it regardless of terrain or circumstance. The only thing that gives a kingfissure worm pause are attacks on their tongues, which are left vulnerable when they are dragging creatures to their impending doom.

#### Unclear Origins

Kingfissure worms have no identifiable sexual characteristics and are extremely territorial. If two kingfissure worms encounter each other, the result is always a cataclysmic duel that ends in one devouring the other. Because of this, most scholars theorize that these creatures reproduce asexually-and that when a kingfissure worm dies, their tongues detach and grow into full-fledged worms. While this has yet to be confirmed, juvenile kingfissure worms have been seen in the wild, most often spotted following animal herds or traveling communities, feeding off of stragglers, refuse, remains, and vermin.

#### Swallowed Survivors

Kingfissure worms never stop growing, and the oldest are truly immense, easily mistaken in the distance for a strangely mobile mountain range. Deep within the bowels of these behemoths, unusual biomes and oversized gut fauna may flourish. In fact, some people who have survived their trip down the gargantuan gullet of one of the great worms have been able to eke out a life-and even form thriving communities-safe inside the spacious lower abdomen of their living quarters.

#### Sensitive Giant

For all their might and vitality, kingfissure worms are primarily ambush hunters, and like any ambush hunter, they need delicate and precise senses to detect and target their prey when it approaches. As burrowing creatures, they have a finely tuned sense of touch able to detect even the most minute vibrations while in direct contact with earth and stone. This fills the role of their primary sense, and their rudimentary eyesight leaves them dreadfully nearsighted. In combination, their poor vision and reliance on ground-conducted vibrations means that they have almost no way of pinpointing flying creatures, and many species of birds find kingfissure worm territory exceptionally safe and free from predators.

###### Kingfissure Worm Malice

At the start of a kingfissure worm's turn or when an action's trigger occurs, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->

## Kobolds

Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat.

#### Defensive Masters

In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold's shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.

Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.

#### Unconventional Tactics

Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn't take them seriously. Their foes haven't experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section).

#### Tiny Dragons

Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons-and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon's scales over several generations.

#### Domain Expansion

When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon's affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon's hold on the territory.

#### Kobold and Dragon Symbiosis

Most dragons are solitary creatures, but kobolds living in a dragon's domain provide both parties with clear benefits. A dragon can establish their domain over an area in half the time if they allow kobolds to settle in the area as well. Meanwhile, a kobold who spends 1 week or more living in the domain of a dragon becomes immune to the hazardous and negative effects of that domain. The kobold's physical appearance might also change the longer they stay in the area.

#### Terrain Mastery

The kobolds' affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature's traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don't give chase. They likely know something you don't about these terrain hazards.

#### Cute Pets

The gummy brick is a deadly ooze-a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins-draconic pangolins-who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side.

#### Kobold Languages

Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.

#### Kobold Malice

At the start of any kobolds's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Maniple Tactics (3 Malice)**
>
> Up to 3 kobolds make a free strike, swaps positions with an adjacent kobold, and then that kobold makes a free strike.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Set the Initiative (5 Malice)**

> Two kobolds take their turns in a row.

> ⭐️ **Shield Wall (7 Malice)**

> Until the end of the round, all kobolds with Shield? Shield! Impose an additional bane on incoming strikes and abilities.

## Lightbender

Lightbenders prowl deserts, plains, forests-any sunbathed wilderness where they can take advantage of the adaptations that make them skilled daylight predators. This monstrous creature's fur bends and refracts light from the surrounding environment, producing mirages that distract and confuse their prey.

#### Hidden Hunters

At a distance, a lightbender looks akin to a regular lion, but closer inspection reveals their glowing eyes, iridescent mane, and a pair of lashing tails spiked with refractive crystals. The lightbender's pelt magically warps light around them to disguise their movement, letting them teleport while leaving behind a past visual imprint. Unsuspecting prey rarely realize they're staring at an afterimage of the lightbender until the predator pounces.

#### Ghostly Echoes

Lightbenders can also bend the sounds they make, enabling them to almost completely disappear during a hunt. Many can delay their footsteps to slip into a silent prowl, while others might throw a guttural trill across a field to lure prey out of hiding. The lightbenders' illusory mastery was said to inspire several techniques taught to shadows within the College of the Harlequin Mask.

#### Protective Companions

Though lightbenders are typically solitary creatures, they sometimes cross into another lightbender's territory to help protect a newborn litter of kittens. A few people have succeeded in taming lightbenders as guards or hunting beasts, and if treated well, they can make loyal protectors, often viewing their smaller humanoid companions as surrogate kittens.

###### Lightbender Malice

At the start of any lightbender's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Silent Prow (3 Malice)**
>
> Each lightbender acting this turn can teleport up to their speed as a move action and attempt to hide as a free maneuver, all until the start of their next turn.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Duplicate (5 Malice)**
>
> Each lightbender acting this turn can create a duplicate lightbender in an unoccupied space adjacent to them. The duplicate is indistinguishable from the lightbender except by supernatural means, has 1 Stamina, and has the lightbender's speed. A duplicate acts on the lightbender's turn but can take only move actions. Once per round before or after using an ability, a lightbender can trade places with any lightbender duplicate.

<!-- -->

## Lizardfolk

Lizardfolk prefer warm, tropical climates, but they're willing to settle in any humid region-the more moisture in the air, the better. Even in colder environs, lizardfolk can be found in any sufficiently marshy environment. Bogs and wetlands are particularly common nesting grounds.

#### Homeland Protectors

Lizardfolk aren't especially hostile unless they feel their territory is threatened-which it often is. Respectful travelers entering lizardfolk territory, however, find no great hardship. Lizardfolk cultures often focus on a specific trade, such as boat building, fletching, navigating, or weaving, and sell their services to travelers in need, including lizardfolk from other places.

Adventurers often cross paths with lizardfolk while trekking through their homelands. The reptilian humanoids watch travelers who skirt too close to sources of food and shelter, attacking those who take more than they need. Many lizardfolk dwell in abandoned ruins and caverns for protection. Treasure seekers who delve into these places are typically given one warning before the attack begins.

#### Focused and Loyal

Most lizardfolk speak plainly, viewing blunt honesty as a sign of respect. When they make a vow or personal promise, they do all they can to honor that word. Lizardfolk who swear to destroy an enemy follow their quarry to the ends of the earth.

#### Marshland Tyrants

In times of crisis, such as a food shortage, an evil lizardfolk leader can exploit the emergency, oppressing others in the name of defending their territory. But there are always other local lizardfolk tribes who oppose such aggressive, expansionist posturing, and they often seek the aid of other folk who value freedom from tyranny.

<!-- -->
> **Lizardfolk Tactics**
>
> Lizardfolk prefer to fight in or near water whenever they can, and if they aren't on a battlefield with water, they perform delaying actions to buy time while they flood the battlefield with their Malice features before attacking with full force. If water is already present, they focus on positioning in the early battle to surround and split up their opponents.
>
> With a wide array of strong grab and forced movement abilities, lizardfolk tactics are that of divide and conquer, locking down strong defenders while abducting and isolating backline heroes. Lizardfolk also have strong teamwork features and rotate units who have lost their tails to more rear positions in favor of healthier units.
>
> **Lizardfolk Sample Encounters**
>
> - **Marsh Hunters, 18 EV:** Eight shellguard, eight tonguers, one scaletooth
> - **Ambushers, 24 EV:** Sixteen grunts, two skyterrors
> - **Scalesworn Detachment, 30 EV:** Eight shellguard, sixteen tonguers, one scaletooth, two bloodeyes
> - **War Party, 48 EV:** Eight shellguard, eight grunts, eight tonguers, one scaletooth, one skyterror, one bloodeye, one deathrex

#### Lizardfolk Languages

Most lizardfolk speak Caelian and their own dialect of Khamish.

###### Lizardfolk Malice

At the start of any lizardfolk's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->

>
> | **Area, Ranged, Weapon** |   **Maneuver** |
> | ------------------------ | -------------: |
> | **📏 1 cube within 3**   | **🎯 Special** |

>
> - **≤11:** Restrained (save ends).
> - **12-16:** Restrained (Eot).
> - **17+:** No effect.
>
> **Effect:** Any creature not also restrained by a net trap who is adjacent to a creature restrained by the trap can free them as a maneuver.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Water Pit (5 Malice)**
>
> A lizardfolk acting this turn unearths a magical size 2 pit that is 2 squares deep and filled with water. Any lizardfolk who moves into, then exits the pit on their turn gains 10 temporary Stamina, regrows their tail if applicable, and ends one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. While adjacent to the pit, any creature who can burrow or who has the Nature skill can make a **Might test** or a **Reason test** to drain it.
>
> - **≤11:** The creature falls into the pit and is knocked prone.
> - **12-16:** The creature fails to empty the pit.
> - **17+:** The pit empties of water.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Flood the Shores (7 Malice)**
>
> Waist-high water floods the entire encounter map. Any lizardfolk submerged in water gains an edge on abilities and doubles their speed while swimming. If there are no open water pits on the encounter map, the water drains away at the end of the round.

## Manticore

A weary traveler hears a call through the forest or friendly voices from a rocky shelter, and their heart leaps at the promise of refuge-only to find themself at the mercy of serrated teeth and poisonous spikes. In a manticore's territory, people go missing without a trace. These fearsome creatures carve out their hunting grounds in forests near small villages, mountain passes where caravans travel, and other locations with plentiful wildlife. Though manticores can subsist on a carnivorous diet of any nearby prey, their choicest meal is humanoid flesh.

#### Uncanny Appearances

A manticore has a lion's body, a dragon's wings, and a scorpion's tail barbed with spines, but their most unnerving trait is their humanoid face. Owing to a quirk of magical evolution, manticores develop the features of common ancestries that populate their region of birth. For example, a manticore in an area densely populated by devils inherits fiendish eyes and devilish horns. Manticores are born with an inherent understanding of a regional language, but they can speak only through mimicking that which they've heard-a talent manticores use to lure in prey.

#### Heralds of Death

Manticores have a magical howl like a trumpet blast. This haunting sound unnerves and terrifies creatures, making them more susceptible to the manticore's bite. While on the hunt, manticores often take to the skies, shooting poison-tipped spikes from their tail to weaken their victims before howling and closing in.

#### Ferocious Companions

A manticore who develops a taste for humanoids can rarely be tamed. But a young manticore who has yet to cut their teeth on such flesh can be raised into a fearsome ally. Even after a trained manticore companion finally tastes delicious humanoid flesh, they typically remain loyal to their caregiver.

#### Manticore Languages

Most manticores can mimic Caelian and one language commonly spoken in the region where they dwell. Except in rare cases, manticores don't communicate in full sentences and are too driven by hunger to engage in negotiation.

#### Manticore Malice

At the start of any manticore's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Uncanny Mimicry (3 Malice)**
>
> The manticore uses their mimicry in an attempt to unnerve one creature within their line of effect. If the target has R < 4, they take a bane on power rolls against the manticore (save ends). Each time this feature is used against the same target during the encounter, its potency decreases by 2.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The manticore takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Desperate Howl (5 Malice)**
>
> The manticore lets out an unnerving cry. Each enemy within the manticore's line of effect makes an **Intuition test**.
>
> - **≤11:** Frightened (save ends)
> - **12-16:** Frightened (EoT)
> - **17+:** No effect.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Barrage of Barbs (7 Malice)**
>
> The manticore sprays tail spikes across the ground within 5 squares of them. Each enemy in that area who has A < 3 is bleeding (save ends). Additionally, the area is difficult terrain, and any enemy takes 3 poison damage for each square of the area they enter. An enemy who takes 9 poison damage this way on one turn is weakened until the end of the encounter.

###### Manticore Treasures

<!-- -->
> **Manticore Treasures**
>
> Although manticores have no earthly use for treasure, they tend to collect a lot of it-it comes attached to the humanoids they prey on. Since manticores drag their victims back to their cave lairs to feed, a manticore's cave is typically strewn with bones, broken weapons, coins, and other relics of unfortunate travelers. After a while , a manticore abandons its cluttered lair in favor of a fresh one, leaving unguarded treasure for anyone willing to explore manticore-infested wastes.
>
> The following are sample treasures from a manticore's cave, of which a manticore might have one or two. These items can be found in Draw Steel: Heroes.
>
> - **Treasures:** Blade of the Luxurious Fop, Bull Shot, Stop-'n-Go Coin
> - **Components:** Adamatine spearheads, a mirror blessed by a priest, pixie wings
> - **Project Sources:** Notes in Zaliac for the Warding II armor enhancement, notes in Khelt for the Celerity implement enhancement, notes in Variac for an Onerous Bow
> - **Wealth:** If the heroes follow blood trails back to a nearby abandoned caravan, each hero earns 1 wealth

## Medusa

Hunted as monsters with no thought given to their nature or origin, medusas are some of the most underestimated and misunderstood creatures. Many people fear medusas for their monstrous appearance and ability to turn others to stone, but few realize the truth. Each of these monstrosities was once a humanoid, cursed and transformed for defying a god. But while some medusas embrace wickedness, many simply fight for their lives against those who threaten them through their ignorance.

#### Cursed for Defiance

When a powerful mortal defies a god for good or for ill, agents of that deity might curse them to live as a medusa. The offender's skin and eyes become reptilian, and a nest of black venomous snakes replaces their hair. When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone.

Followers of the gods who imposes this punishment spread terrifying myths about medusas, causing mortals to attack and shun them. This often drives medusas into solitude, or to places haunted by creatures who don't judge them based on mere appearance and horror stories. Many medusas plot ways to break their curse, searching for lost healing rituals or secrets to use against the gods who cursed them. Others embrace their new gifts, building stone gardens of the aggressors who foolishly hunted or harmed them.

#### Petrification

Petrification can take a character out of the game permanently. If you want to give the heroes a chance to recover an ally petrified after an encounter with a medusa, you can let them use the Find a Cure downtime project in *Draw Steel: Heroes* to discover an ancient ritual that can return a petrified creature to life. Alternatively, a medusa might have the power to reverse the state of a petrified victim if left alive, or there might be a temple nearby with a priest who knows how to cure petrification... for a price.

#### Serpentine Reflexes

While the medusa's stone gaze is legendary, they can move, strike, and evade as swiftly as a snake, even briefly manifesting scaled wings to dart through the chaos. This enhanced dexterity makes them difficult to pin down. Their petrifying gaze allows them to attack at range as necessary, but they're equally deadly in melee, where they have the full advantage of their snakes and the enervating venom pulsing through each snake's set of needlelike fangs.

#### Baleful Magic

Medusas have many means to defend themselves, even aside from their petrifying stare. They slow enemies down, weaken them, and can even temporarily charm and control them once petrifying magic takes root in their veins. These reclusive beings are no stranger to being outnumbered and overwhelmed. All they have in their power to gain leverage over their opponents, they wield ruthlessly.

#### Stone Gardens

Medusas often reside in stone gardens filled with statues of those who previously tried to slay them. This not only allows them to slip between their statues, hide, and then strike, but it also allows them to command the battle while in their lairs, shattering statues to harm others. Evil medusas sometimes slowly reverse the petrification of their victims one limb at a time to feed on them, creating grotesque mausoleums of the crumbling dead for unwitting adventurers to wander into.

#### Lifting the Curse

Agents of the deity who ordered a medusa's curse can sometimes be convinced to lift the punishment, usually in response to the medusa undertaking an impossible task in the god's name or making a threat that can't be ignored. Some sages claim that ancient rituals can undo the curse, but these lost secrets are often hidden by wrathful divine servants-and performing such a ritual might entail great sacrifice.

#### Medusa Languages

Medusas can speak any language they knew before they were cursed. Many of them speak Caelian, and others have learned the languages of monsters and creatures they dwell near. Additionally, tales tell of some medusas who speak the original form of Khamish.

###### Medusa Malice

## Minotaurs

The fearsome minotaur is a study in contrasts. Their imposing humanoid body is muscular with patches of thick hair. Their head is that of a massive horned bull, and their soft eyes convey a soulful intelligence mingled with smoldering intensity.

### Primal Rage

Minotaurs burn with fury. Some constantly desire to unleash this destructive energy on the world, and they attack anyone or anything that crosses their path. Others make it a point of pride to control their rage, only fighting when survival demands it. Regardless, once combat begins, minotaurs relish charging at foes with their great horns. In the heat of battle, a minotaur charges from one foe to the next, only retreating if victory is impossible.

### Labyrinthine Origins

The first minotaur was once the human warrior Thesia "The Bull" Danaria, who dared challenge the Beast Lords of Kham. When her revolution was crushed, the Lords of Kham used their beastmagics to twist Thesia's mortal body into a human-bull hybrid prone to fits of violent rage. The Beast Lords placed this minotaur at the center of a vast labyrinth and sent captured rebels to attack the monster. Many fell to Thesia's anger-until a prisoner named Velathri took a chance, speaking to the minotaur instead of brandishing steel. He befriended Thesia, and in retribution, the Beast Lords made him a minotaur as well. This act was their undoing, for Thesia and Velathri fell in love.

New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands. Even today, many minotaurs shun civilization, preferring to live in winding canyons, twisting ruins, bewildering dungeons, or other labyrinthine terrain where they can continue to hunt. However, small numbers of minotaurs can be found in nearly any terrain or settlement.

### Deep Bonds

Even evil minotaurs can be fiercely loyal friends, gladly charging into certain death for those they trust. These chosen friends never suffer the creature's ire-but gods help them if they betray the minotaur.

### Minotaur Languages

Most minotaurs speak their own dialect of Khamish.

### Minotaur Malice

At the start of any minotaur's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Bull Rush (3 Malice)**
>
> For each 3 Malice spent, one minotaur acting this turn gains a +4 bonus to speed and ignores difficult terrain until the start of their next turn.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Cut the... Nonsense! (5 Malice)**
>
> One minotaur acting this turn halves any damage they take, and can use the Knockback maneuver as a free triggered action whenever an enemy comes adjacent to them, all until the start of their next turn.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Bullseye (7 Malice)**
>
> All minotaurs in the encounter fill the area around them with psychic impressions of feeling lost and isolated. Each enemy within 5 squares of a minotaur is teleported up to 5 squares and makes an **Intuition test**.
>
> - **≤11:** The target has line of effect only within 3 squares and is frightened of all minotaurs (save ends).
> - **12-16:** The target has line of effect only within 3 squares (EoT).
> - **17+:** No effect.

## Ogres

Massive and bull-necked with bulging muscle and flesh, most ogres indulge their every impulse because few can stop them. Though small for giants, ogres outweigh and tower over humanoids. Most live in the wild where they can create their own rules and ways of life.

### Extreme Emotions

Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross, and one is more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart's desire, be it food, riches, or friendship.

Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place.

### Savory Stories

Some ogres speak of a time when they shared vast wealth and riches, great homes made of hewn stone, and sumptuous feasts. These stories always end tragically, each with a different villain-from deceptive mages to talking cats-swindling the ogres of what is rightfully theirs. The truth of such legends remains unknown, but many cruel ogres use them as an excuse for their selfish indulgences.

### Aristocracy of Bullies

When wicked ogres gather more food than they can stomach or riches than they can spend, they use the excess to tempt their kin into working for them. These petty rulers make other ogres grovel at their feet for table scraps, then send them out into the world to steal more. Many ogre communities form around these arrogant aristocrats-but few such leaders die of old age, as the ambition and emotions of their subjects bring about violent ends.

### Cyclops: Ogre Progenitor

Ogres originally descended from the cyclops, an old-world giant with a single eye whose kind still roam through remote canyons and valleys. These behemoths stand heads above the ogres and are twice as destructive once they've spotted their prey. But while their binocular cousins have gone on to become successful hunters and live for themselves, the cyclops is a scavenger hindered by their poor eyesight. Most cyclopses are eager to work for and defend powerful warlords or wealthy ogres, as long as they have easy access to food and shelter.

Rumor has it that a cyclops can emit a mile-long energy ray from their eye. However, focusing such power is nearly impossible when their vision is usually too irritated and clouded by dirt.

### Ogre Languages

###### Ogre Lairs

<!-- -->
> One of the great tragedies of the ogres is that they keenly appreciate luxuries but are the wrong size to use most of them. Although ogres can guzzle fine wines and perch stolen crowns atop their heads, they can't fit into small folks' fine clothes, wield their tiny weapons, or sit in their chairs without smashing them to splinters. Nevertheless, ogres often decorate their lairs with costly furniture, decorations, suits of armor, and other prizes-sometimes in less than mint condition.
>
> The following are sample treasures from an ogre's lair, of which an ogre might have one or two. These items can be found in Draw Steel: Heroes.
>
> - **Treasures:** Giant's-Blood Flame, Growth Potion, Icemaker Maul

## Olothec

Protean in form, beings of nearly pure intellect, the Old Ones think in alien geometric logic. Their name for themselves is unrecorded, but sages believe they are the oldest beings in the timescape and simply call them "The Old Ones." Synlirii refer to them as olothec (*OH-luh thek*)-"ancient enemies." But some humanoid scholars have noted this term bears an uncanny similarity to another archaic synlirii word meaning "ancient ancestor."

### Immortal Evil

Across countless cultures and ancestries, olothec feature in nightmares and temple friezes alike. While their origins are obscure and may never be known, their hatred of the mundane world and every living thing in it is well recorded. Olothec channel psionic energy beyond any mortal power, surpassing even the voiceless talkers. To them, a living creature who can't reshape their own flesh is repugnant, an unnatural abomination requiring eradication-or transformation.

### Agents of Chaos

Olothec consider the primordial chaos that spawned them as the ideal state of existence. They have long warred against the voiceless talkers, loathing their constant manipulation and refinement of evolutionary forces. Where olothec lair in forgotten sea tunnels and beneath ancient ruins, they surround themselves with slime servants-humanoids, beasts, horrors, and others, all devolved to a perfect physical and mental state.

### Primordial Form

At first sight, an olothec seems like little more than a rippling mass of tentacles, twisting around each other like a shifting shroud. Creatures who get too close discover each of those tentacles ends in a ravenous mouth set with razor-sharp teeth. Each mouth is tipped by a cluster of three eyes that focus the olothec's relentless attacks. In water or on land, fetid slime coats the horror, protecting them against attackers and acting as a conduit for their fearsome psionic power.

### Mutations of the Flesh

Millennia of practice have allowed olothec to perfect psionic abilities that devolve and transform their victims into primordial life forms. Exposure to the psionic slime of an olothec's tentacles can change a creature into a mindless, oozing thrall. The most powerful olothec have unique powers that further warp flesh.

### Olothec Languages

Most olothec communicate telepathically using Mindspeech and speak Urollialic. Many also know Old Variac and Caelian, but converse in those languages only when necessary.

<!-- -->
> **Content Warning: Body Horror**
>
> Most olothec are creatures of incomprehensible evil who use their psionic might to reshape the flesh of their enemies. Their stat blocks contain strong elements of body horror. You should feel free to modify any of these effects for the safety of you and your players.

###### Olothec Malice

> The olothec broadcasts their memory of the universe in its primordial state-a sweeping cacophony of transcendental irrationality and unceasing change.

## Orcs

In a long-lost language, the word oruk-"blood fire"-described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin ("the people") in their own language, they also use "orc" with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.

Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They've settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers' than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.

#### Relentlessly Tough

Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they're excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.

Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with "blood fire," glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.

#### Innate Power

The intense power of an orc's spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature's spirit.

#### Mohlers

Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests-and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs' enemies off their feet.

When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.

#### Scyzas

Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza's trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.

#### Orc Languages

Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.

###### Orc Malice Malice Features

At the start of any orc's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Overwhelming March (3 Malice)**
>
> Each orc shifts up to their speed, moving through enemy spaces if they can. Each enemy passed through during this movement makes a **Might test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 6 damage; prone
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; prone
> - **17+:** Push 2

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Mohler Trench (5 Malice)**
>
> An orc acting this turn summons 2 **mohlers** out of the ground, who dig a trench that is a 10 x 1 line within 10 squares when they appear. The trench is 2 squares deep and is difficult terrain. The trench can't be created directly underneath creatures.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Mohler Cavity (7 Malice)**
>
> The ground shakes as a group of mohlers dig a 5 cube pit beneath an area where at least one creature is on the ground. The area is difficult terrain. Each orc in the area can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the pit before it is completed. Each nonorc in the area makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 4 damage; the target falls; prone and can't stand (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; the target falls
> - **17+:** The target can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the pit.

## Radenwights

The ratfolk known as radenwights are blessed with coordination and acrobatics so impressive and effective that they might be a highly trained and practiced circus act. They enjoy building their warrens, known as "meddles," under cities where the chaos of daily life makes raiding the people above fun and easy.

When the radenwights' enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they are painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever the ratfolk do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through for even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren't above banditry if it would support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.

### Bonds and Bravado

It's a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk, and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by running away or climbing to safety gets you only so far. Radenwights learn boldness from birth, and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community-as well as the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it's not one radenwight's blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows.

### The Magic of Music

The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among radenwights, though the community throws their support behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist whose playing enraptured an evil dragon-even as others in her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped on the creature from the cliff above.

### The Great Maclette

The name Maclette is never uttered by radenwights without "The Great" before it. That maestro leads his band in complex city-wide robberies while always staying one step ahead of any would-be ratcatchers. Some say Maclette leads his life of crime to provide for his meddle, while others claim he strives to be king of the criminal world.

In truth, the Great Maclette finds beauty in the thrill of the heist. Robbery is as euphonious as music to his ears, and the maestro treats every operation like a new composition. As long as his band remains at large, he'll always be looking to outdo himself with his next great overture.

### Radenwight Languages

Most radenwights speak Caelian and Szetch.

###### Radenwight Malice

Each square of the wall has 10 Stamina.

## Rivals

They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town's job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They're rivals-heroes just like you. Maybe even better.

Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in *[Draw Steel: Heroes](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Heroes)*-the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters' own heroic journey.

#### Rival Stat Block List

#### Using Rivals in a Campaign

These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class's fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won't be fumbling for a stat block. That's what rivals are for.

#### Rival Ancestries

You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.

#### Rival Abilities

Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in *[Draw Steel: Heroes](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Heroes)*), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival's signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival's level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.

#### Rival Languages

Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.

###### Rival Malice Level 1+ Malice Features

At the start of any rival's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Work as One (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, each rival can impose a bane on a strike made against an adjacent rival as a free triggered action.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **We Just Do It Better (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, whenever any rival makes a power roll against the target of their Rivalry trait, they roll a d3 and add it to the power roll.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Check Out Our Loot (5 Malice)**
>
> One rival pulls out a magic consumable and hurls it, targeting a 5 x 1 line within 1 square of them or a 3 cube within 10 squares of them. Each enemy in the area makes an Agility test. The rival chooses a damage type and a condition for the outcome of the test from one of the following pairs: sonic damage and dazed, poison
>
> - **≤11:** damage and weakened, or fire damage and frightened. 11 damage; the condition affects the target (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 8 damage; the condition affects the target (EoT)
> - **17+:** 5 damage

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Calling the Shots (7 Malice)**
>
> Each rival regains 10 Stamina. Until the end of the round, whenever a rival uses an ability against an enemy, each other rival adjacent to that enemy can make a free strike against them.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Coordinated Takedown (10 Malice)**
>
> Each rival moves up to their speed and uses a main action or maneuver that doesn't cost Malice.

###### Customizing Rivals

> Rival stat blocks fill out a typical party in terms of roles, but you can easily change them to represent a class that isn't presented here. For example, you can make a troubadour by using the elementalist as a starting point and making the following changes:
>
> - Make Presence their highest characteristic.
> - Replace their signature ability with the troubadour's Cutting Sarcasm ability (adjusting it to target two creatures and deal extra damage equal to the troubadour's level).
> - Replace their second main action with Quick Rewrite.
> - Replace their triggered action with Turnabout Is Fair Play.
>
> You can also use the fury as a starting point for a censor by making the following changes:
>
> - Reverse their Might and Agility scores.
> - Replace their signature ability with the censor's Your Allies Cannot Save You ability (adjusting it to target two creatures and deal extra damage equal to the censor's level).
> - Replace their second main action with Behold a Shield of Faith.
> - Replace their trait with Lead By Example.

### Rivals-2nd Echelon

The rivals have learned a few new tricks since they last encountered the heroes. Rivalry is a two way street, however, and they'll be sorely disappointed if the heroes can't keep up.

#### The Black Iron Pact

A secret society created to overthrow Capital's political and cultural structure, the Black Iron Pact draws its name from Ajax's sobriquet, the Iron Saint. Iron is a metal with deep symbolism to the tyrannical saint.

The five most powerful members of the pact-the High Command formally lead the society and serve as its strike team. The identity and whereabouts of the Black Iron Pact's original founder are closely guarded secrets, known only to Ajax and the High Command.

The pact's true numbers also remain a mystery, and many citizens work for them unknowingly. Such subterfuge ensures the pact's agents can't be traced back to the High Command.

###### Goals

The Black Iron Pact's primary goal is the conquest of Capital and the installation of Ajax as its ruler and god. The pact's agents are true believers of Ajax's gospel, which seeks change through force and violence. Their evil belief is that humans are the true owners of this world, and as such, only humans can join the Black Iron Pact, though the society employs nonhuman pawns when risk of capture or death is high.

Additionally, many members of the pact-notably senior member Erasmus and his wife Avalla-openly sneer at the idea of guilds (essentially scorning everyone in the middle class), and they object to anyone but a human man holding public office, owning any assets, or even learning to read.

**Running the Black Iron Pact**

The Black Iron Pact is an example of a 5th-level rival party. You can use the following statblocks, modifying each rival with the human ancestry.

- **Lord Erasmus Deseo:** Rival Tactician
- **Canon Athenodorus:** Rival Conduit
- **Cloak:** Rival Shadow
- **Lady Avalla Deseo:** Rival Elementalist
- **Qar, Master of Jackals:** Rival Null

## Shambling Mound

Rich soil squelches under every footstep. Curtains of menacing vines block the way, and muffled groans echo distantly under the darkening canopy. But by the time a hapless explorer realizes the ground is moving, it's too late-the shambling mound has devoured them.

Found in overgrown swamps, stinking marshes, dense wodes, and dark, damp rainforests, the shambling mound is a wandering mass of vegetation that feeds on everything in their path.

### Noxious Origins

A shambling mound is most often a byproduct of nearby hags or mages, especially evil ones or those utilizing green magic. Latent magic seeps into the surrounding land, coalescing into a nocuous creature consumed by hunger. The shambling mound knows only that they must grow, and that to grow they must feed-and thus they wander in search of a hunting ground.

It is believed these magical origins are what give shambling mounds their ability to produce poisons, which vary from region to region. For example, the toxins from a shambling mound along coastal beaches or swamps might appear milky white and smell sweet like manchineel trees. Meanwhile, shambling mounds found in rainforests might give off a heady, intoxicating sweet scent at night, luring victims in with beautiful pale blooms like angel's trumpets and producing intense hallucinations for those unfortunate enough to become poisoned. But while their specific effects might change, each shambling mound's toxins typically have the same aim: enervate their foes and then magically absorb that lost strength and vitality.

<!-- -->
> **Alchemical Ingredients**
>
> After a shambling mound dies, a creature can make a Reason test to extract toxins from the remains.
>
> - **≤11:** The creature extracts no toxins.
> - **12-16:** The creature extracts enough toxins to craft one vial of poison.
> - **17+:** The creature extracts enough toxins to craft three vials of poison.
>
> Creating poison from the extracted toxins requires the completion of a special crafting project (see Chapter 12: Downtime Projects of *Draw Steel: Heroes*).
>
> - **Item Prerequisite**: Shambling mound toxins
> - **Project Source**: Texts or lore in Caelian
> - **Project Roll Characteristic**: Reason or Intuition
> - **Project Goal**: 45
>
> As a maneuver, one vial of poison can be applied to a weapon. For 1 minute after the poison is applied, damage dealing abilities using that weapon deal an extra 4 + 1d6 poison damage.

### Hearty Eaters

As a shambling mound drags their massive form through the undergrowth, they consume any organic matter they pass. What is more satisfying, however, is when they find a shadowed, overgrown place to lurk until the meal comes to them-a veritable feast for little effort. After a mound engulfs their prey, be they animal or adventurer, the meal-to-be is sealed in a sack of interwoven vines and leaves. This vegetative hunter can then sap the strength of those within to feast or empower itself.

### Verdant Core and Expansive Sprawl

When fighting a shambling mound, most attention is drawn to the cavernous chamber that holds their consumed victims. However, the shambling mound protects a smaller magic crux at their core with a knot of vines, leaves, and other natural defenses. The mound can expose this core to free up their form and become deadlier, thus opening themselves up to more potential harm.

One must also be wary of the area around a shambling mound. Their vines reach out far, the full extent of their form hidden among other flora until they strike.

###### Shambling Mound Malice

At the start of a shambling mound's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Poisoned Vines (3 Malice)**
>
> The shambling mound seeps noxious residue from their vines. The next time they use their Vine Lash ability before the end of their next turn, they deal an extra 12 poison damage to each target.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Frenzy Lash (5 Malice)**
>
> The shambling mound lashes out at each enemy within 10 squares of them, driving them back or into the air. Each target makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 7 damage; push 7 or vertical push 3; restrained (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 6 damage; push 5 or vertical push 2
> - **17+:** 3 damage

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The shambling mound takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Leeching Wilds (7 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the shambling mound's next turn, the area within 10 squares of them is difficult terrain for enemies, and any enemy in the area takes a bane on power rolls. Any enemy who starts their turn in the area takes 4 acid damage, and the shambling mound regains an equal amount of Stamina.

An engulfed creature is restrained, takes 3 poison damage at the start of each turn, and can't take damage from abilities used from outside the sack.

## Time Raiders

Genetic rebels, the space punks known as the time raiders (called the *kuran'zoi* among themselves) scour the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, for heavily laden ships of any type. But they prefer the ships of UNISOL and other empires, for they love raiding the frigates of powerful governments who think their money and imperious nature can buy security.

### Veterans of the Psychic Wars

Thousands of years ago, the synlirii-those powerful and evil psionic horrors more commonly known as voiceless talkers-created the kuran'zoi as soldiers. But as the synlirii experimented with and enhanced these warriors' psionic potential, the kuran'zoi came to understand the true nature of their progenitors. They rebelled against the synlirii and fled to the Sea of Stars, becoming nomads of the timescape.

### Hardened-Vision Hexapods

Kuran'zoi possess resilient ocular sensors that allow them to see in the dark. Knowing these sensors would also defend them against the hardlight storms of the Astral Sea, the escaping kuran'zoi chose the Sea of Stars as their home. They thrive where the winds of limbo roar.

Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran'zoi is like a squad unto themself.

### Psi-Tech

Like their synlirii foes, time raiders travel on mindships and wield psionic weapons and tools that only their people can activate. Many kuran'zoi specialize in melee weapons that psionically devastate enemies, but time raider vertexes also learn to pilot enormous suits of psionic armor that empower their allies.

### Genre Raiders

The moniker "time raider" is a bit of a misnomer. Because they are pirates of the upper worlds, whenever a time raider hunting party arrives in Orden the locals assume these must be warriors from the future, wielding marvelous weapons of light that hit as hard as steel.

### Leave a Few Alive

Time raider pirates plunder the vessels they target, but allow just enough of the crew to survive so the ship can make it back home. Kuran'zoi pirate captains often remind their crews: "Leave the sheep alive. Next year, they'll return with a new coat of wool for us to shear."

### Creatures Outside Time

While in the Sea of Stars, time raiders and other creatures don't age. As a result, many living kuran'zoi recall the Psychic Wars. They carry the lessons learned from millennia of conflict with the synlirii into new battles with devastating effect, using mindships to launch attacks on other planes and appearing exactly where they want to. However, this knowledge serves them far beyond war. Time raiders raise their young in ruined citadels and similar strongholds on obscure worlds, keeping their creches secret and protected.

### Time Raider Languages

Most time raiders speak Caelian and Voll. Because of the number of worlds they've visited, many time raiders have their speech peppered with misplaced tenses and strange references.

###### Time Raider Malice

At the start of any time raider's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Gravity Well (3 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Psionic, Ranged, Weapon** |   **Maneuver** |
> | --------------------------------- | -------------: |
> | **📏 5 cube within 3**            | **🎯 Special** |
>
> **Effect:** A time raider acting this turn activates a gravity well in the area. The gravity well sits at the center of the cube and lasts until the end of the encounter, or until a creature adjacent to the well uses a maneuver to deactivate it. The area is difficult terrain for enemies. Any enemy who ends their turn in the area is pulled up to 4 squares toward the well.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Recall Module (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, each time raider gains a +3 bonus to speed, and can teleport up to their speed as a move action.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Psi-Cage (10 Malice)**
>
> All time raiders in the encounter collectively create a psionic field over the encounter map, which lasts until the first time raider with the highest Stamina maximum drops to 0 Stamina or chooses to end the field (no action required). While the field is up, each non-time raider on the map makes a **Reason test** against this psionic effect at the start of each round.

## Trolls

Ravenous trolls rampage through the wild to quell their fathomless hunger, leaving only destruction in their wake. Tall and gangly, they have mottled green skin covered by a mane of matted hair that runs down their neck and back. In many ways, they resemble massive humanoids, but their exaggerated features belie this comparison. A troll's lower jaw hangs unhinged and distended, and their long arms end in claws that drag along the ground as they walk.

### Hypermetabolism

A troll's constant hunger and aggression beget a life of violence. Like a grotesque miracle, they quickly assimilate consumed flesh into themselves to regenerate their body. Some scholars think this extreme metabolic process is the source of their hunger, but none know for certain which came first.

### Phases of Destruction

Fortunately for the ecosystems they inhabit, trolls can't be active all the time. Their natural behavior is to hunt relentlessly for a few days, then return to their dens to rest for as much as a week. Patient troll hunters can wait for this torpor and catch their quarry by surprise-though the cost of waiting can be high thanks to the damage a troll might do in the meantime.

### Strange Mutations

Trolls prefer to prey upon humanoids and animals, but stories tell of them feeding on fetid demons and undead, assimilating those creatures' flesh to magnificent and horrifying effect. A troll with loose hanging skin, curling nails, or exposed bone might be in better health than their appearance would suggest.

### Limbjumbles

When a suitably large piece of a troll is torn off in battle, it does its very best to keep on living. Deep-seated survival instinct goes into overdrive, causing the detached piece to sprout unthinkable assortments of malformed arms and legs. Though these limbjumbles are ultimately short-lived, they can often be found tumbling awkwardly behind living trolls.

<!-- -->
> **Mutating Your Trolls**
>
> At the director's discretion, a troll can mutate after consuming the flesh of any creature and gain some of their damage immunities, traits, abilities, and movement options. For instance, a troll who devours the carcass of a dead draconian might grow wings and gain their signature ability!
>
> Be aware that this can increase the difficulty category of an encounter while one or more of these mutated trolls are present-especially if their mutations enable them to deal more damage than normal or grant them an acid or fire damage immunity.

### Troll Languages

Most trolls speak High Kuric or Variac, while a few also know Caelian. Trolls are notably difficult to negotiate with unless heroes can provide more appetizing food than themselves.

###### Troll Malice

At the start of any troll's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Foul Spew (3 Malice)**
>
> One troll acting this turn spews out a half-digested meal in a 5 x 1 line within 1 square of them. Each troll in the area regains 3 Stamina. Each enemy in the area makes a **Might test**.
>

> - **12-16:** 10 acid damage; weakened (EoT)
> - **17+:** 6 acid damage

<!-- -->
> 🗡 **Emergency Meal (5 Malice)**
>
> Each troll in the encounter can make a free strike against a creature adjacent to them, and regains Stamina equal to the damage dealt.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Bloody Banquet (7 Malice)**
>
> Each winded troll in the encounter disgorges the contents of their stomach onto the ground around them, creating a 1 burst of foul vomitus that lasts until the end of the encounter. Each non-troll who enters this area for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes 5 acid damage. Each troll in the area has a double edge on power rolls.

## Undead

Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.

Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people's fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.

### Dark Places

For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun's golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.

### Encountered Together

Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don't need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.

### Corporeal Undead

At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can't think beyond the orders of their creators-unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren't controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.

The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.

### Spectral Undead

Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person's vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer's fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.

Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.

<!-- -->
> **Spectral Undead and Phasing**
>
> All spectral undead have some kind of phasing trait that enables them to move through creatures and objects at their usual speed. However, they can't end this movement inside a creature or object while in combat. Outside of combat, a spectral undead might hide themself inside a statue, painting, or other object. But when battle begins, they can't remain within or fall back to that cover to prevent being attacked.

### Undead Languages

Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life.

### Undead-1st Echelon

It's rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren't careful.

###### **Undead Malice (Level 1+ Malice Features)**

At the start of any undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Ravenous Horde (2 Malice)**
>
> At the end of this round, each hero not already adjacent to one or more undead is beset by two **rotting zombies** who burst up from the ground to appear in adjacent unoccupied spaces. Each zombie is winded. This feature can't be used two rounds in a row.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Paranormal Fling (3 Malice)**
>
> Up to three unattended objects on the encounter map rise to float 1 square off the ground. Each object is then pulled 5 squares toward the nearest enemy within 3 squares of the object.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **The Grasping, the Hungry (5 Malice)**
>
> Ravenous and rotting undead arms burst forth from 9 connected squares of a vertical or horizontal surface. Any creature who ends their turn adjacent to an affected square makes an Agility test.
>
> - **≤11:** 5 damage; restrained (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 5 damage; restrained (EoT)
> - **17+:** 5 damage
>
> **Effect:** While restrained this way, a creature takes 1d6 damage at the start of each of their turns.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Dread March (7+ Malice)**
>
> Up to four undead in the encounter move up to their speed and can make a free strike. The number of undead affected increases by 1 for each additional Malice spent on this feature. If an undead is reduced to 0 Stamina during this dread march, they don't die until the march is resolved.

### Undead-2nd Echelon

More powerful and more self-aware forms of undead rise above the undead horde and lay claim to dark, isolated domains all their own. The longer an undead is allowed to thrive, the stronger they become.

#### Mummies

Mummies are humanoids raised from the dead through a complex series of magical rituals. The process tethers a creature's soul to their earthly body, preventing them from crossing into true death. As part of the mummification process, a corpse is embalmed and wrapped in cloth imbued with necromantic power. Mummification is reserved for situations of grave import. A great hero might voluntarily be mummified upon death to eternally guard future generations or a holy relic. On the other hand, a great villain could be mummified to prevent them from escaping their crimes through death.

#### Vampire Spawn

Vampirism is a curse of blood that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life that nonetheless hunger for life's essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims.

Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their living forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves. A vampire's power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and their master's orders. Few spawn survive long enough to become true vampires.

#### Mournlings

Powered by sorrow and rage, these hulking amalgamations of dirt or flesh defend the homes of their creators, brutally attacking intruders while sobbing uncontrollably. Mournlings express far more emotion than many other undead guardians, for their makers imbued them with sadness and loss. Though their druidic creators are long-dead, some original mournlings still defend forests, mead ows, and other natural places they were built to protect.

Outside of battle, mournlings patrol for interlopers in a trance-like state. When an unknown creature creates a disturbance or approaches them, the mournling unleashes a primal cry that conveys the very essence of suffering, then bursts into violence. They continue to sob and moan even as they viciously beat their enemies to a pulp.

###### Undead Malice (Level 4+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 4 or higher undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (2-7+ Malice)**
>
> The undead activates a Malice feature available to undead of level 3 or lower.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Blood Hunger (5 Malice)**
>
> One undead acting this turn uses a signature ability against a creature who is bleeding. As a free triggered action, each undead within 5 squares of the first undead moves up to their speed and can make a free strike against the same target.

### Undead-3rd Echelon

Older, taboo methods of creating devastating undead wildly vary from one another. These wretched creatures can come about by way of accursed blood rituals, terrible operations, a spirited collective resistance to death, or other unspoken methods once thought lost to time.

#### Koptourok

Koptourok is a Variac name that roughly translates to "dead tourist." It's given to those who meet their end suffocating in the depths, whether they drowned in a subterranean lake, wandered into a cave of trapped gas, or were crushed by a rockslide. These rasping, slouching undead rise from their grave desperate for the one thing they've lost: breath.

#### Haunt

Born of mass death events that leave multiple souls stranded in agony together, a haunt is a violent collective chaos driven by a hatred for the living. A haunt lays claim to the scene of their death, which their grief forbids them from leaving so as to strand them in the mundane world. None of the souls within a haunt are necessarily malicious, and all would individually prefer to move on and find peace. But their accumulated grief drives them to tremendous anger that inspires sadistic acts of violence against the living.

#### Waxen

When a corpse is preserved improperly, its body fat can become a substance known as corpse wax. Necromancers sometimes harvest and use this foul substance to enhance their undead minions, transforming them into waxens. These awkward, loping creatures cake their foes in foul-smelling wax to slow and sicken them. Waxen minions are often set ablaze by unscrupulous masters, sacrificing them to the flames but making them significantly more dangerous in the process

#### Vampires and Vampire Lords

By drinking the blood of a true vampire, a vampire spawn can transcend their feral beginnings and rise to become a true vampire themself. The path of transformation is daunting, and vampires who end up starved for blood often band together for mutual protection. But with patience and cunning, a vampire can grow old and powerful enough to control vast amounts of territory and countless vassals.

The term "vampire lord" thus refers not to a specific age or threshold of physical prowess, but rather to status and influence. A vampire who refers to themself as a lord invites challenges to their title and is prepared to crush all those who seek to end their reign.

###### Undead Malice (Level 7+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 7 or higher undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (2-7+ Malice)**
>
> The undead activates a Malice feature available to undead of level 6 or lower.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Necrotic Rupture (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, whenever an undead is reduced to 0 Stamina, they deal 8 corruption damage to each enemy within 3 squares of them.

### Undead-4th Echelon

The deadliest of undead creatures can be placed into one of two categories: terrible machines that know only destruction, and powerful tyrants who aren't content with conquering just death.

### Bonecage

The weakness of many undead minions means that necromancers at war often find themselves shy of corpses when their forces lose more numbers than they slay. The bonecage offers a horrifi c solutio n t o thi problem. This hulking creature made from giants' bones is structured like a massive cage that they can cram dead and near-dead corpses into. Trawling the scenes of great battles, the bonecage fills themself with the fallen, stealing them away for ill purposes. Of course, when no mass casualty site presents itself, the bonecage is more than capable of making corpses of their own.

### Lithgekh

Every mage who lives long enough eventually contends with the fact that their knowledge will one day leave the world. For those who can't stomach this idea, seeking the immortality of the lich often becomes an irresistible temptation. But many of those who try and fail to achieve lichdom become lithgekh-a word in the First Language meaning "lich corpse." Having failed to create a proper soul vessel, a lithgekh suffers an eternal hunger for magic to sustain themself. Liches will sometimes trick or tempt mortal mages into pursuing lichdom, only to sabotage them and create a lithgekh under the lich's control. These servants are prized by liches for their ability to disrupt enemy magic and empower their own.

###### Undead Malice (Level 10 Malice Features)

## Count Rhodar Von Glauer

After falling to a vampiric curse in his early twenties, Count Rhodar the last Lord of Glauer-ruled his tiny, heavily forested mountainous county in eastern Rhöl for three hundred years. There were worse overlords, the people said. After all, Rhodar took his pact with the people and the land seriously. He aggressively defended the villages in his demesne against constant incursions from rival counts and barons. He believed his power waxed and waned with the prosperity of the people and the vitality of the land.

Each new moon, when the Red Tax came due, the count would visit a young candidate, then emerge with renewed vitality. Across the land, folk feared their Dragon Count, but the witches of the wood wove a prophecy: "The land's darkest hour shall be the redemption of House von Glauer."

Eventually, the conquering force of Emperor Gaius VIII came for Rhodar-not because he was a vampire, but because the empire wanted his land and people. Count von Glauer was staked, and his body burned to ash. The emperor kept the Rod of Count Rhodar von Glauer as a trophy, and with this symbol of authority, he sealed his claim to the land.

Under new rule, Rhodar's people lament the absence of their lord, recalling the time before the coming of the empire as a golden age. But the witches' whispers can still be heard. For as long as the people of Glauer persist, they continue believ¬ing their Dragon Count will return in their darkest hour to deliver them from tyranny.

### Excerpt from the Chronicle of the Chain of Acheron

"In those days the Chain was in service to the Emperor Gaius VIII, third of the Five Crusading Emperors, and 27th Emperor of Caelia. Gaius continued the crusades started by his illustrious granduncle. Those were profitable days for the Chain, the Wheel, and the Gate. While the other Helltroopers waded into the deserts of Khoursir and Khemhara, we battled in the forests of Vaslor. We had it easy. I hate deserts.

"Thinking his vampiric power would save him, Count Rhodar von Glauer waited until he was fulsome in his strength before trying to extend his dark realm into Caelian territory. But we know how to deal with vampires. The black and gold standard of the von Glauer family reads, "I do the devil's work." We can attest to that. We lost many souls to that long siege, but in the end, we staked him. An old woman howled at us saying, "He is the land!" but we hear that stuff all the time. We sacked his castle, burned his forest and orchards, and delivered his staff to the emperor. That was harder than it sounds. Finger had to drop it in one of his bottomless sacks to stop the mists from coming. What the emperor will do with it, I don't know. I fear that staff may hold more than the power to make the mist."

- Dancer, Chronicler of the Chain of Acheron, Heroes 228

### A Lordly Beast

In spite of the fact that he literally preyed upon them (though only one a month!) the people of Glauer seemed to take great pride in their immortal count. Many historical sources record Von Glauer's noble bearing. He took his role as protector and defender of the people and their well-being seriously, in keeping with the traditions of classical nobility. Invited guests must be treated with decency, insults demand apology or satisfaction. Debts must be repaid, treaties honored.

Those who violated the law or threatened his people met a very different Count. It was said he stalked his enemies in the guise of a great wolf, or winged gangrenous beast.

In his humanoid form he treated guests, even enemy commanders with honor and dignity. What his demeanor might be should he return is unknown.

### The Darkest Hour

It's been over a thousand years since The Chain of Acheron staked Von Glauer, but the wise women of Rhöl speak as though the Dragon Count is merely on vacation. Ajax killed the Earl of Rhöl during his conquest of Vasloria but has yet to dispatch anyone to rule in their stead.

For people of Glauer, the wise women's prophesy feels close. They sense the import of the times in which they live, and expect Ajax or one of his lieutenants to return to rule with an iron fist. The people speak openly now of their Dragon Count returning to defend them against this possibility.

How his return might be possible is not clear, but it would surely involve the Rod of Count Rhodar Von Glauer, currently held under the city of Capital in the Great Reliquary of the Last Emperor, also known as Ringwell.

### Count Rhodar's Languages

Rhodar speaks Caelian and Vaslorian.
