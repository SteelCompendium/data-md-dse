<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Blade Wall (5 Malice)**
>
> The ashen hoarder summons a 10 wall of bones and blades into unoccupied squares within 5 squares of them. Each square of the wall has 5 Stamina. An enemy who comes adjacent to the wall for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes 3 damage.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Bone Storm (7 Malice)**
