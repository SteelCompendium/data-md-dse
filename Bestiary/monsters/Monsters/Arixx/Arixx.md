## Arixx

Pebbles dance as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon's peace, and an arixx blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.

An arixx is a chitinous burrowing insectoid beast who stands taller than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.

#### Pastoral Pest

Although arixxi can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. An arixx hunts alone, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make the arixx virtually impossible to eradicate-unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain arixx.

#### Terror of the Thaw

Arixxi are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, arixxi hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace. But this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every arixx awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.

###### Arixx Malice

At the start of an arixx's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Burning Maw (3 Malice)**
>
> The arixx dribbles acid over their mandibles, causing the next strike they make to gain an edge and deal an extra 3 acid damage.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Geyser (5 Malice)**
>
> The arixx's underground tunnels swell with pressure, causing a sudden influx of hot gas to burst from a 3-square-by-3-square area anywhere on the surface. Each enemy in the area makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 4 damage; vertical push 5
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; vertical push 3
> - **17+:** The target shifts to the nearest unoccupied space outside the area.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The arixx takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Earth Sink (7 Malice)**
>
> The encounter map suddenly quakes, then begins to sink. Each creature on the ground who has A < 1 is knocked prone. Until the end of the encounter, each creature who starts their turn on the ground and can't burrow must spend 1 additional square of movement to leave their starting position, or 2 squares if they start their turn prone or underground. A creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space on the ground and can't burrow sinks 1 square into the ground.
