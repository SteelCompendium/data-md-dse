###### Chimera Malice

At the start of a chimera's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Defensive Snapping (3 Malice)**
>
> The chimera takes up a defensive stance. Until the start of their next turn, the chimera can make a free strike against each enemy who comes within 2 squares of them.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The chimera takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Unstable Terrain (5 Malice)**
>
> The chimera shakes the ground, causing an eruption of loose rocks and debris that creates three size 2 stone objects anywhere on the encounter map. Each creature adjacent to one or more objects when they appear who has A < 2 takes 5 damage.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Ashen Clouds (7 Malice)**
>
> Until the start of the chimera's next turn, all areas of the encounter map are shrouded in a thick cloud of ash. All creatures and objects on the map have concealment that the chimera ignores. Additionally, each enemy in the cloud who has I < 1 has line of effect only within 3 squares. The potency of this feature increases by 1 each time it's used.
