###### Medusa Malice

At the start of a medusa's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🏹 **Weakening Glare (4 Malice)**
>
> | **- Magic, Ranged, Strike** |     **Main action** |
> | --------------------------- | ------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**            | **🎯 One creature** |
>
> **Power Roll + 4:**
>
> - **≤11:** 6 damage; weakened (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 10 damage; weakened (EoT)
> - **17+:** 12 damage; weakened (save ends)

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The medusa takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🏹 **Ssstop and Lisssten (5 Malice)**
>
> | **Magic, Ranged** |        **Main action** |
> | ----------------- | ---------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Three creatures** |
>
> **Power Roll + 4:**
>
> - **≤11:** I < 2 the target is charmed
> - **12-16:** I < 3 the target is charmed
> - **17+:** I < 4 the target is charmed
>
> **Effect:** At a time of the medusa's choosing, a charmed creature moves up to their speed and makes a free strike against an enemy of the medusa's choice as a free triggered action. The creature is then no longer charmed.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Shatter Victims (7 Malice)**
>
> The medusa causes three stone statues within 10 squares of them to each shatter in a 2-cube explosion. Each enemy in one of those areas makes a **Might test**. An enemy restrained or slowed by the medusa's Petrify ability has a double bane on the test.
