###### Valok Malice

At the start of any valok's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Repeater (3 Malice)**
>
> One valok acting this turn takes an additional main action.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **I Was Not Commanded to Wait (5 Malice)**
>
> At the end of each turn until the end of the round, one valok can either shift up to 2 squares or make a free strike.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Rapid Logic Overdrive (7 Malice)**
>
> Each valok in the encounter can end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw, and can move up to their speed (making use of the bonus below). Additionally, until the end of the encounter, all valok deal an extra 5 damage on strikes and gain a +5 bonus to speed. This feature can be activated multiples times, stacking the effects.
