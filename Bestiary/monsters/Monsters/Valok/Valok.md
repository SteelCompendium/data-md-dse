## Valok

Abandoned autonomous machines made by the ancient steel dwarves, valok can still be found deep within the crumbling ruins and underground structures of long-dead civilizations. The steel dwarves made their instruments well, though, and valok can still be activated! However, doing so without the correct control phrases could unleash an unstoppable machine overloaded by the weight of time.

#### Exotic Metal Body

Steel dwarves unlocked the secrets of smithing valiar-the truemetal prized not only for its strength and flexibility, but for its entrancing silvery white beauty. They could turn valiar into anything, from breathtaking weapons and exquisite buildings to hypnotic gossamer fabrics that are nearly transparent and virtually indestructible. The secrets of working with the truemetal disappeared with the steel dwarves, but not before they built the nigh-invulnerable bodies of the valok.

#### Prismacore Power

The steel dwarves also mined iridoss, commonly known as prismacore. This rare gemstone was infused with the power of other worlds. Unlike other constructs who are powered by spells or prayer, each valok's prismacore heart allows them to operate without magic. Since prismacore never loses power, valok can work ceaselessly, without rest or respite.

### Mechanized Evolution

The first valok were great machines made to dig, smelt, and build. Legends say these giant walkers could build entire cities in a matter of days, and could even construct other valok. As the steel dwarves learned the deep secrets of prismacore, they made machines who could speak and think more freely.

While two classes of valok-servok and multivok-have been discovered, ancient steel dwarf carvings hint that a highly advanced third class was created just before their makers disappeared.

### Ancient and Deep

Ruined valok litter the deepest ruins of the steel dwarves, and without the steel dwarves' secrets, their valiar and iridoss are useless to modern smiths. But some valok still labor in the depths, carrying out the orders given to them long ago and ready to end any who interfere.

#### Valok Malice Malice Features

At the start of any valok's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> üë§ **Repeater (3 Malice)**
>
> One valok acting this turn takes an additional main action.

<!-- -->
> üåÄ **I Was Not Commanded to Wait (5 Malice)**
>
> At the end of each turn until the end of the round, one valok can either shift up to 2 squares or make a free strike.

<!-- -->
> ‚≠êÔ∏è **Rapid Logic Overdrive (7 Malice)**
>
> Each valok in the encounter can end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw, and can move up to their speed (making use of the bonus below). Additionally, until the end of the encounter, all valok deal an extra 5 damage on strikes and gain a +5 bonus to speed. This feature can be activated multiples times, stacking the effects.

### Servok

Servoks, the labor and siege class of valok, are huge, slow, and built for a specific purpose-though all are designed to defend themselves when threatened. No humaniform servoks have yet been discovered. Their forms depend on their purpose, but they are never smaller than a wagon. Despite each servok's utilitarian construction and the ages of grime accumulated atop their valiar, they are impressive to behold.

Servok builders once constructed buildings, roads, and walls. Some active builders still work the caverns where they were left, clearing the ground in preparation for lost grand projects known only to their progenitors. Servok miners dug the legendary tunnels of the steel dwarves. A few miners still bore deep into the earth, searching for ore and ready to destroy anything that interferes with that function.

The quaking of earth and the boom of an arcane cannon precedes the appearance of a servok war engine. Built to roll through enemy ranks with their bladed rake, the war engine can also eliminate targets from afar with a massive gun that shoots both magic blasts and burning oil. Many war engines went to battle and never returned, and where they wander now, they consider every creature they meet who isn't a steel dwarf to be an enemy.

#### Multivok

Smaller than servoks, multivoks can speak and carry out commands, though their capacity for complexity is limited. While multivoks are humaniform, their masterfully crafted bodies lack the expression and fine articulation of humanoids. They were built to run and maintain ships and ore harvesters, survey dangerous or distant locations, guard nobles, and oversee servoks-tasks which many multivoks tirelessly attempt to continue today.

With arms ending in axe blades and repeating crossbows mounted on their shoulders, a multivok bodyguard cuts an impressive figure. Multivok bodyguards who are still active are often found watching over the bones or possessions of their long-dead charges with unfaltering loyalty.

One of the most advanced multivoks, a chief directs and coordinates other valok to get work done. Multivok chiefs were built to oversee projects in the absence of steel dwarf supervisors. Active chiefs still roam the halls of the steel dwarves, organizing their fellow constructs to protect treasures, construct buildings, dig tunnels, and destroy invaders.

### Valok Languages

Most valok communicate exclusively in Rallarian.
