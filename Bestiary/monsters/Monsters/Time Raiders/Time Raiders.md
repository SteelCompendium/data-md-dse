## Time Raiders

Genetic rebels, the space punks known as the time raiders (called the *kuran'zoi* among themselves) scour the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, for heavily laden ships of any type. But they prefer the ships of UNISOL and other empires, for they love raiding the frigates of powerful governments who think their money and imperious nature can buy security.

### Veterans of the Psychic Wars

Thousands of years ago, the synlirii-those powerful and evil psionic horrors more commonly known as voiceless talkers-created the kuran'zoi as soldiers. But as the synlirii experimented with and enhanced these warriors' psionic potential, the kuran'zoi came to understand the true nature of their progenitors. They rebelled against the synlirii and fled to the Sea of Stars, becoming nomads of the timescape.

### Hardened-Vision Hexapods

Kuran'zoi possess resilient ocular sensors that allow them to see in the dark. Knowing these sensors would also defend them against the hardlight storms of the Astral Sea, the escaping kuran'zoi chose the Sea of Stars as their home. They thrive where the winds of limbo roar.

Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran'zoi is like a squad unto themself.

### Psi-Tech

Like their synlirii foes, time raiders travel on mindships and wield psionic weapons and tools that only their people can activate. Many kuran'zoi specialize in melee weapons that psionically devastate enemies, but time raider vertexes also learn to pilot enormous suits of psionic armor that empower their allies.

### Genre Raiders

The moniker "time raider" is a bit of a misnomer. Because they are pirates of the upper worlds, whenever a time raider hunting party arrives in Orden the locals assume these must be warriors from the future, wielding marvelous weapons of light that hit as hard as steel.

### Leave a Few Alive

Time raider pirates plunder the vessels they target, but allow just enough of the crew to survive so the ship can make it back home. Kuran'zoi pirate captains often remind their crews: "Leave the sheep alive. Next year, they'll return with a new coat of wool for us to shear."

### Creatures Outside Time

While in the Sea of Stars, time raiders and other creatures don't age. As a result, many living kuran'zoi recall the Psychic Wars. They carry the lessons learned from millennia of conflict with the synlirii into new battles with devastating effect, using mindships to launch attacks on other planes and appearing exactly where they want to. However, this knowledge serves them far beyond war. Time raiders raise their young in ruined citadels and similar strongholds on obscure worlds, keeping their creches secret and protected.

### Time Raider Languages

Most time raiders speak Caelian and Voll. Because of the number of worlds they've visited, many time raiders have their speech peppered with misplaced tenses and strange references.

###### Time Raider Malice

At the start of any time raider's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Gravity Well (3 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Psionic, Ranged, Weapon** |   **Maneuver** |
> | --------------------------------- | -------------: |
> | **📏 5 cube within 3**            | **🎯 Special** |
>
> **Effect:** A time raider acting this turn activates a gravity well in the area. The gravity well sits at the center of the cube and lasts until the end of the encounter, or until a creature adjacent to the well uses a maneuver to deactivate it. The area is difficult terrain for enemies. Any enemy who ends their turn in the area is pulled up to 4 squares toward the well.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Recall Module (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, each time raider gains a +3 bonus to speed, and can teleport up to their speed as a move action.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Psi-Cage (10 Malice)**
>
> All time raiders in the encounter collectively create a psionic field over the encounter map, which lasts until the first time raider with the highest Stamina maximum drops to 0 Stamina or chooses to end the field (no action required). While the field is up, each non-time raider on the map makes a **Reason test** against this psionic effect at the start of each round.
>
> - **≤11:** 10 psychic damage; slowed (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 7 psychic damage; slowed (EoT)
> - **17+:** No effect.
