## Elementals

When the gods formed the mundane world, they took sparks of creation from the roiling plane of Quintessence and gave sentience to some of the multiverse's most basic elements-air, earth, fire, and water. Many elementals contain just one of these components, but can come to embody multiple reagents as they age.

#### Duality of Form

Elementals are mercurial creatures of creation, destruction, and transformation. Though the deities first created the mundane world, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn't suit an elemental, they break it down with elemental fury then build it anew.

Elementals change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are protectors armored by stone, lizards ablaze with fire, and sometimes dragons clad in steel.

#### Rebirth and Reformation

When an elemental dies in the mundane world, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain their strength. Should the spirit return to the mundane world, they take on a form that reflects a creature or other aspect of that plane.

#### Crux of Fire

Cruxes of fire, often called blazecasters, take the form of fiery lizards. They commonly live in hot zones of planar convergence or areas of volcanic activity. These territorial elementals usually question interlopers from afar-and if they don't like the answers, they rain down fire before their foes can draw near.

Though many elementals weave their innate gifts into oral storytelling, cruxes of fire are particularly adroit at animating their stories in silhouettes of flame.

#### Essence of Storms

At a distance, most would mistake an essence of storms, sometimes known as a galeweaver, for a large bird of prey. This majestic creature is formed from streaks of colored cloud stuff woven into the silhouette of a large eagle or falcon.

Galeweavers act as scouts for their handlers or for groups of elementals, and they're usually the first to spot trouble. Insatiably curious, an essence of storms often swoops down to talk when they observe travelers.

#### Essence of Tides

An essence of tides looks like a shimmering blue manta ray that glides over land as easily as through water, earning them the common name of tidedrifter. Most common along coastlines, essences of tides enjoy harmless pranks, especially against folk who regularly sail or swim in their waters.

Tidedrifters have a healthy sense of humor that makes it easy to win their friendship-but their relaxed demeanor evaporates if friends or family face threats.

#### Field of Growth

The field of growth takes the form of a massive centipede made of vegetation. Often called verdant primevals, these caretakers of the natural cycle of life (and death) fight those they see as upsetting that cycle. Fields of growth seek not only to destroy undead and those who create them, but to sabotage divine servitors who casually peddle resurrection magic.

#### Force of Earth

A protective earth elemental, a force of earth resembles a nine-foot-tall great ape formed of dirt and rough stone. They act as guardians and historians when among other elementals, working tirelessly to thwart ills from befalling the group. These elementals are sometimes called earthen bulwarks.

#### Elemental Languages

Most elementals speak Low Kuric. Some can use Caelian when they need to.

###### Elemental Malice

At the start of any elemental's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->

> Two elementals on the encounter map teleport to swap places, and each has damage immunity 2 until the end of the round.

<!-- -->
> üë§ **Split (5 Malice)**
>
> An elemental acting this turn cleaves themself into two separate elementals. Each elemental has the same statistics as the original, except that each has half the original's current Stamina and is one size smaller. Both elementals can then shift up to their speed.
