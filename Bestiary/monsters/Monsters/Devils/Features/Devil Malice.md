###### Devil Malice

At the start of any devil's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Bureaucratic Tape (3 Malice)**
>
> One devil acting this turn uses a signature ability against an adjacent creature. On a tier 3 outcome, the target of the ability has a double bane on strikes (save ends).

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Underhanded Tactics (5+ Malice)**
>
> One or two devils can teleport to a space adjacent to one or more creatures who aren't hidden and make a free strike. For each 2 additional Malice spent on this feature, one additional devil can teleport.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Read the Small Print (7 Malice)**
>
> Each enemy in the encounter is subject to a bad deal proposed by the devils. An enemy must choose between having damage weakness 5 or taking a bane on power rolls. The bad deal lasts until the end of the encounter.

<!-- -->
> **Devil Temptations**
>
> Although some devils enjoy comfort and opulence for their own sake, they primarily use treasure as bargaining chips in fiendish compacts: bait on the devils' infernal barbs.
>
> Even more sinister than a prize won in a devil's hard bargain is a gift freely given by a devil. The advantages of such a gift are conditional, lasting only until the devil revokes it at some inconvenient time.
>
> The following are samples of the wonders that a devil can offer-to only the most discriminating customers, of course. A devil might only have two or three of these items available for trade, but others (such as an archdevil's wing) can be won by force. See *Draw Steel: Heroes* for more information about how these items can be used by heroes.
>
> **Components:** An archdevil's wing, archdevil's blood, soul chalk, a wide selection of true names
>
> **Project Sources:** Notes in Anjali for the Devil's Bargain armor enhancement or a Hellcharger Helm, notes in Hyrallic for a Mediator's Charm
>
> **Titles:** Diabolist, Maestro
>
> **Treasures:** G'Allios Visiting Card, Thief of Joy
>
> **Wealth:** Each hero can earn 1 wealth in exchange for a small favor
