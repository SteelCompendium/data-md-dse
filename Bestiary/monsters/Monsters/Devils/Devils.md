## Devils

In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly for power and control-a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes. Devils are distinguished from other humanoids by skin in shades of azure and crimson, as well as their hellmarks: horns, tails, hooves, wings, and other infernal features.

### Precarious Pyramids

The Seven Cities of Hell stand atop strict hierarchy and bureaucracy. Primordial chains of command place each devil in service to a more powerful devil, with the seven archdevil rulers of Hell at the top. While devils are lawful, they're always looking for another way up the ladder. They twist every rule to their benefit to gain power and usurp those they answer to, eager to uncover loopholes in the eternal struggle for significance and supremacy.

### Silver Tongues

Winsome devils can acquire significant influence by bargaining for the souls of mortals on behalf of the archdevil they ultimately serve. Virtuosos with words, devils are skilled at striking deals and forging contracts. They exploit the weaknesses of mortals, whether greed, revenge, vanity, or simple desperation. In the heat of battle, a devil's supernatural charisma can influence a mortal to do their bidding, often without realizing until it's too late.

<!-- -->
> **Negotiations with Devils**
>
> Devils are eager to negotiate and strike deals, but often require more compelling arguments and concrete evidence from the other party. You can pick from the following motivations and pitfalls to quickly create a devil from one of the Seven Cities for a negotiation (see Chapter 11 in *Draw Steel: Heroes*):
>
> - **Motivation:** Greed, Power, Legacy
> - **Pitfall:** Benevolence, Freedom, Protection
>
> During a negotiation, an NPC devil has their impression and patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Their interest goes up to 10 instead of 5.
>
> When an NPC devil is ready to make an offer, divide their interest by 2 to get their final response. A devil typically never settles a negotiation unless they're promised something desirable in return.

### True Names

All devils have two names: one by which they're commonly known, and another secret true name. Each devil zealously safeguards the latter, as their true name can be spoken aloud to aid in summoning them-or in stripping them of their power.

### Hell's Defectors

Not every devil in the Seven Cities wants to ruthlessly ascend the hierarchy. Some desire advancement, but they remain dissatisfied at the bottom. As luck would have it, these fiends can free themselves from Hell's bureaucracy, for when a mortal overestimates their fortitude and dies while enacting an infernal summoning, it can leave an enterprising devil stranded in the mundane world.

### Devil Languages

Most devils speak Anjal and Caelian, among other languages. The more powerful a devil, the more languages they learn in order to more easily make ironclad contracts with a wide variety of people and cultures. Outside of rare circumstances, devils are always willing to negotiate, ever desiring to twist a situation in their favor.

###### Devil Malice

At the start of any devil's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Bureaucratic Tape (3 Malice)**
>
> One devil acting this turn uses a signature ability against an adjacent creature. On a tier 3 outcome, the target of the ability has a double bane on strikes (save ends).

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Underhanded Tactics (5+ Malice)**
>
> One or two devils can teleport to a space adjacent to one or more creatures who aren't hidden and make a free strike. For each 2 additional Malice spent on this feature, one additional devil can teleport.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Read the Small Print (7 Malice)**
>
> Each enemy in the encounter is subject to a bad deal proposed by the devils. An enemy must choose between having damage weakness 5 or taking a bane on power rolls. The bad deal lasts until the end of the encounter.

<!-- -->
> **Devil Temptations**
>
> Although some devils enjoy comfort and opulence for their own sake, they primarily use treasure as bargaining chips in fiendish compacts: bait on the devils' infernal barbs.
>
> Even more sinister than a prize won in a devil's hard bargain is a gift freely given by a devil. The advantages of such a gift are conditional, lasting only until the devil revokes it at some inconvenient time.
>
> The following are samples of the wonders that a devil can offer-to only the most discriminating customers, of course. A devil might only have two or three of these items available for trade, but others (such as an archdevil's wing) can be won by force. See *Draw Steel: Heroes* for more information about how these items can be used by heroes.
>
> **Components:** An archdevil's wing, archdevil's blood, soul chalk, a wide selection of true names
>
> **Project Sources:** Notes in Anjali for the Devil's Bargain armor enhancement or a Hellcharger Helm, notes in Hyrallic for a Mediator's Charm
>
> **Titles:** Diabolist, Maestro
>
> **Treasures:** G'Allios Visiting Card, Thief of Joy
>
> **Wealth:** Each hero can earn 1 wealth in exchange for a small favor
