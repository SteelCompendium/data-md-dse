The tower has three floors, an entrance in the middle of each side on the ground floor, and a crenelated rooftop. Any war dog inside or adjacent to the tower has damage immunity 2 and regains 5 Stamina at the start of each of their turns, and war dogs inside the tower can observe through and have line of effect through its walls. This ability can be used only once per encounter.
