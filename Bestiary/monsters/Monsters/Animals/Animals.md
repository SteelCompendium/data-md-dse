## Animals

The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal-to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to *become* monsters. A hero wouldn't mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves-but they'll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.

### Animal Traits

This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal's most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block's EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.

<!-- -->
> **Lots of Options!**
>
> When using animal traits, think about using one mobility trait and either a defensive or an offensive trait to capture the sense of the animal. Other animal traits that don't need to be on the stat block can emerge naturally through gameplay, such as a cat taking no damage from a fall.

#### Animal Stat Blocks

The following stat blocks can be used to describe everyday animals capable of acting as threats or challenges to the heroes under appropriate circumstances. Alternatively, you can add traits to these stat blocks to describe animals of a specific type. If you're adding traits to animal stat blocks, build out your custom animals ahead of time to lessen the amount of flipping back and forth between stat blocks and traits during play.

#### Animal Notation

When building an animal by adding traits to a stat block, you can use a shorthand to describe the animal. For example, a dire wolf might be denoted as "Predator B: Swiftness, Pack, Hunter" to indicate that you're using the Predator B stat block with the Swiftness, Pack, and Hunter traits.

The Example Animals table breaks out a number of animals using this notation. Selected traits are listed in order by category-mobility, defensive, offensive, and supernatural.

<!-- -->
> **Can I Make a Harmless Animal?**
>
> You certainly can! Animal traits can be applied to the **noncombatant** stat block to make unimposing animals the heroes can rescue (see Harmless Creatures in the Introduction section). Surviving a wild animal attack can also be handled through group tests and montage tests as if those animals were environmental challenges to overcome rather than individual threats.
