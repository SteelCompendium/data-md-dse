## Gnolls

Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll's muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack's eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.

#### Born From Blood

The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas-bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As'sylrak the Warper.

As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends "gnoll," an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is "to consume completely." And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.

#### Ceaseless Hunger

The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn't receive As'sylrak's blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh-and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.

#### Gnoll War

Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren't choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.

#### Abyssal Hyenas

Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.

#### Tusker Demons

Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves-enemies and allies alike.

#### Gnoll Languages

Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac.

#### Heroes Beware!

When gnolls go into a frenzy and coordinate their individual Cackletongue maneuvers, few heroes will leave the battlefield unscarred. Any 1st-echelon encounter that contains more than two non-minion gnolls can be considered one difficulty category harder at the Director's discretion.

###### Gnoll Malice

At the start of any gnoll's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Iron Jaws (3 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Ranged, Weapon** |   **Maneuver** |
> | ------------------------ | -------------: |
> | **📏 1 cube within 3**   | **🎯 Special** |
>
> **Effect:** A gnoll acting this turn drops an iron-jawed snare into the area. The first time any enemy moves into the area, they make an **Agility test**. If they were unaware of the snare, the test takes a bane.
>
> - **≤11:** 6 damage; bleeding (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; bleeding (EoT)
> - **17+:** No effect.
>
> **Effect:** While an enemy is bleeding this way, each gnoll in the encounter gains an edge on strikes made against them.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Bloodpool (5 Malice)**
>
> One gnoll minion suddenly explodes into a pool of blood, splattering the area within 3 squares of them. Any gnoll who starts their turn in this area deals an extra 5 damage on their next strike before the end of their turn. Once per round, an abyssal hyena who starts their turn in the area turns into a **gnoll marauder**, keeping their current Stamina.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Echoes of Laughter (7 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the encounter, the encounter map is encased in a soundscape of laughter and howling. Each enemy takes a bane on the first power roll they make each round. Whenever a gnoll is killed, this effect is suppressed until the start of the next round.
