###### Gnoll Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of any gnoll's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Iron Jaws (3 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Ranged, Weapon** |   **Maneuver** |
> | ------------------------ | -------------: |
> | **📏 1 cube within 3**   | **🎯 Special** |
>
> **Effect:** A gnoll acting this turn drops an iron-jawed snare into the area. The first time any enemy moves into the area, they make an **Agility test**. If they were unaware of the snare, the test takes a bane.
>
> - **≤11:** 6 damage; bleeding (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; bleeding (EoT)
> - **17+:** No effect.
>
> **Effect:** While an enemy is bleeding this way, each gnoll in the encounter gains an edge on strikes made against them.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Bloodpool (5 Malice)**
>
> One gnoll minion suddenly explodes into a pool of blood, splattering the area within 3 squares of them. Any gnoll who starts their turn in this area deals an extra 5 damage on their next strike before the end of their turn. Once per round, an abyssal hyena who starts their turn in the area turns into a **gnoll marauder**, keeping their current Stamina.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Echoes of Laughter (7 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the encounter, the encounter map is encased in a soundscape of laughter and howling. Each enemy takes a bane on the first power roll they make each round. Whenever a gnoll is killed, this effect is suppressed until the start of the next round.
