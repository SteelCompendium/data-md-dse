###### Lich Malice

At the start of a lich's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Soul Sip (3 Malice)**
>
> The lich makes a free strike against one enemy within 20 squares. They then gain an edge on their next power roll.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The lich takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Spirit Shell (5 Malice)**
>
> The lich summons a swirling cloud of angry spirits to surround them until the start of the next round. Any creature who deals damage to the lich with a melee strike while the spirit shell is active makes a **Presence test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 16 psychic damage, dazed (save ends)
> - **12-16:** Dazed (save ends)
> - **17+:** No effect.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Cloud of Deceit (7 Malice)**
>
> The lich summons a mind-altering mist, turns invisible until the start of their next turn, and moves up to half their speed. Each enemy within 20 squares of the lich's starting point who has I < 4 is deceived. While deceived, a creature perceives all allies and enemies as the lich, and perceives the environment as an unfamiliar wasteland corrupted by necrotic blight. If other creatures attempt to communicate with a deceived creature, that creature interprets their words as ghastly taunts in the lich's voice.
>
> This effect lasts until an affected creature takes damage or an ally uses a main action to shake them out of it. Each time this feature is used during an encounter, the distance of the effect decreases by 5 squares (to a minimum of 5 squares) and the potency increases by 1.
