## Griffons

With the head, front legs, and wings of a bird and the powerful body and haunches of a feline, griffons are the apex predator's apex predator. Highly territorial with ranges spanning hundreds of leagues, these air-superiority hunters make quick work of any humanoids foolish enough to stumble into griffon lands.

#### Coveted Mounts

Attempting to capture a wild griffon typically ends in injury or worse, though humanoids who hatch griffons in captivity and raise them from birth find they make loyal companions. Some humanoid cultures raise griffons as mounts for the military or city guard, and griffon eggs can fetch a fine price.

Daring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by beak or talon. So great is the death toll that many localities have outlawed the poaching of griffon eggs.

#### Inaccessible Aeries

Griffons roost alone or in pairs on craggy mountainsides, in forests, or on cliffs overlooking the ocean. They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can't fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for three months starting in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then remain in or near the nest as their parents feed them. About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly-and after that, it's only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby.

#### Rare Breeds

Griffons come in many varieties. While the most common griffon is the leonine eagle, others include a falcon-panther variety, a bearded vulture-clouded leopard variety, and a striped condor griffon that combines the features of condor and tiger. Questions abound as to whether these creatures came about naturally or were fashioned by magic hands, and many scholars offer abundant rewards to adventurers who can bring them evidence of rare or undiscovered griffon types.

###### Griffon Malice

At the start of any griffon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
