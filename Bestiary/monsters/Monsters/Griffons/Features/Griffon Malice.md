###### Griffon Malice

At the start of any griffon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Swoop (3 Malice)**
>
> | **-**       | **Maneuver** |
> | ----------- | -----------: |
> | **📏 Self** |  **🎯 Self** |
>
> **Effect:** The griffon flies up to their speed, and can make a free strike against each creature who makes an opportunity attack against them during this movement.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Piercing Cry (5 Malice)**
>
> A griffon acting this turn unleashes a hideous screech at one enemy within 5 squares of them, forcing that creature to make an **Intuition test**.
>
> - **≤11:** Frightened (save ends)
> - **12-16:** Frightened (EoT)
> - **17+:** No effect.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Wildwinds (10 Malice)**
>
> Winds bluster and blow across the encounter map. Until the end of the encounter, each creature who can't fly or isn't mounted on a flying creature takes a −3 penalty to stability, and any forced movement effect targeting such a creature moves them an additional 5 squares.
