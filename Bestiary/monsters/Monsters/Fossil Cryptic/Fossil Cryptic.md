## Fossil Cryptic

The cave-diving humans who first found fossil cryptics initially thought they were the fossilized reanimated skeletons of creatures predating recorded history. When the explorers' priest presented a holy symbol and attempted to turn the cryptics, he learned these fossilized bones aren't mindless undead-and seconds later, he wound up crushed to death by a pillar of stone.

#### Primal Sentries

In truth, these living fossil amalgamations are inhabited by elemental spirits. Fossil cryptics are found in places of otherworldly beauty with a connection to an elemental plane of Quintessence, often in caves that have remained untouched for eons or whose tunnels are laced with veins of priceless metal in exquisite fractal patterns. Elemental spirits from that plane inhabit the fossils of creatures who once protected the site, carrying on their legacy. Archaeologists, miners, and others who disturb a cryptic's domain are ground into dust and subsumed into the creature's own form.

#### Bones of the Earth

Though fossil cryptics vary wildly in their chosen shape and form, all contain a central cluster of fossils atop a churning column of rock and metal. With malleable limbs extending from their earthy core, cryptics move with unsettling speed.

#### Ancient Intelligence

Fossil cryptics often warn trespassers to leave their domains, speaking threats in ancient languages before attacking. Should trespassers persist, cryptics weaponize columns of stone at range and can manipulate the ground around them, pushing and pulling friend and foe alike into the best positions for battle.

#### Fossil Cryptic Languages

Many fossil cryptics speak Phorialtic, but they are known to also use the ancient languages of the ruins they inhabit.

###### Fossil Cryptic Malice

At the start of a fossil cryptic's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🏹 **Floor Mosaic (3 Malice)**
>
> The fossil cryptic slides one creature on the ground up to 5 squares. If the creature is prone, this forced movement ignores stability.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The fossil cryptic takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Stone Pillars (5 Malice)**
>
> Two pillars of stone 1 square wide either thrust up out of the ground or jut down from the ceiling anywhere on the encounter map, to a height of up to 5 squares. A creature in the area of a pillar before it appears is knocked prone on its surface. If the creature comes into contact with the ceiling above or the floor beneath the pillar and has M < 2 they are restrained (save ends).

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Choking Dust (10 Malice)**
>
> The air across the encounter map is thick with dust until the end of the encounter. Each enemy in the dust is suffocating. Additionally, at the end of each round, each enemy in the dust makes a **Might test**.
>
> - **≤11:** Until the end of the enemy's next turn, their stability is reduced to 0, and any forced movement effects targeting them gain a +2 bonus to the distance moved.
> - **12-16:** The enemy's stability is halved (EoT).
> - **17+:** No effect.
