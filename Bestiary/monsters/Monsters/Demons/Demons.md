## Demons

Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun.

The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.

### Mortal Alliances

Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.

### Soul Reavers

Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.

### Lethe

When a demon's soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe-a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.

### Demonic Hierarchy

Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don't use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service.

Each time a demon consumes a soul, there's a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt-or heroic.

### Demon Languages

Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.

### Demons-1st Echelon

A number of lesser demons have been identified across categories 1 to 3.

**Pitlings** resemble rodents or insects with gleaming green eyes and terrible body odor, and disgorge a viscous, toxic phlegm.

**Ensnarers** are the result of pitlings getting hold of an unfortunate soul. A pitling in the process of digesting the soul of a creature has that soul physically bore through their head to become a fanged appendage. Mouths form across the creature's body, each attacking with long, barbed tongues.

**Frenzieds** are similar to ensnarers, but their transformation into a true demon is more advanced. This results in a fast and vicious creature full of energy and hungry for more souls.

**Bendraks** (BEN-drax) appear as an amalgamation of flesh and the shards of broken mirrors, which they use to distract and confuse their foes. A bendrak can divert an enemy's attack to another enemy, and can hide themselves or allies behind dazzling reflections.

**Mucerons** (MIU-sur-onz) are the result of an ensnarer going through repeated demon evolutions to become a brutish creature. They are covered in multiple mouths that shoot out barbed tongues, tearing at enemies as they are dragged out of position.

**Remasches** (REE-mash-iz) have physical forms blended with the nature of the wastes where they dwell. A remasch teleports around the battlefield, inflicting chaos on their enemies directly or through the minions they control. These demons are rumored to be the initial source of the teachings of all shadows through the College of Black Ash.

**Ruinants** (rew-in-ANSE) are possessed of glowing eyes and tendrilringed maws, their bodies covered in inflamed scars and their breath coming as a sickening wheeze. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the demon's own body.

**Torlases** (TORR-lahs-iz) are piecemeal abominations whose physical forms don't obey the mundane laws of geometry. They control the battlefield by using living flesh and whipping allies and enemies alike into advantageous position.

**Chorogaunts** (cor-roh-GAWNTS) are terrifying demon leaders. Each is an amalgamation of several demon bodies formed into a mobile musical instrument. Several heads are arranged into a chorus embedded in the demon's chest, and their ribs are upturned into a fleshy pipe organ. Their attacks entrance and confuse enemies, making them more vulnerable to other demons.

###### Demon Malice (Level 1+ Malice Features)

At the start of any demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Soulburn (3 Malice)**
>
> Each demon acting this turn has a double edge on abilities.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Abyssal Evolution (7 Malice)**
>
> A demon minion of your choice transforms into a non-minion horde demon of the same level.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Abyssal Rift (7 Malice)**
>
> Two size 2 rifts to the Abyssal Wasteland appear at locations of your choice. Any demon can use an abyssal rift as a portal to another abyssal rift in the encounter, moving into any space in one rift and appearing immediately in any unoccupied space in the other rift. A non-demon who enters a rift for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes corruption damage equal to the level of the highest-level demon on the encounter map. An abyssal rift is an immovable object that has 25 Stamina, damage immunity 2, and holy weakness 5. The rift closes when there are no demons remaining on the encounter map. Additionally, a creature who has the Magic or Psionics skill can make a Reason test or Intuition test as a maneuver while adjacent to a rift to destabilize and close it.
>
> - **≤11:** The rift remains open and regains 5 Stamina.
> - **12-16:** The rift remains open.
> - **17+:** The rift closes.

### Demons-2nd Echelon

As demons consume more souls and their mercurial forms shift into more powerful ones, they begin to evolve more distinct personalities, desires, and intelligence-often based on the souls consumed. Across categories 4 to 6, demons develop a particular taste for certain types of souls, which eventually come to define them should they survive long enough.

**Grulqins** (GRUHL-kinz) consist of a bulbous head, two powerful arms, and a circular serrated blade of bone that runs down the middle of their head.

**Orliq** (or-LEEK) are made of shifting bone plates surrounding a swirling core of corruptive energy.

**Wobalas** (WOH-buh-luss) prefer to kill from afar while protected by allies, firing psychic bolts from bows shaped of their own flesh and sinew.

**Bale eyes**, sometimes called "flesh moons," are colossal floating orbs of roiling, dripping flesh. A weeping seam in that flesh opens to reveal a demonic eye whose gaze turns creatures' mental and physical faculties upside down.

**Fanglings** have bodies overgrown with teeth, fangs, and tusks from countless creatures. They are deadly in close quarters, to attackers and bystanders alike.

**Fiktin** (FIK-ten) are cunning hunters who disguise themselves as mundane objects, leaving a foul-smelling oily red residue wherever they have been. Their true form is a humanoid shape made of red oil.

**Gunge** (GUHNJ) demons are horrifically distended, with maws that can swallow a horse whole. A gunge vomits up bilious slime that traps and dissolves any creature unlucky enough to get caught in it.

**Tourmenauks** (tor-min-AUX) resemble a hulking ape with a dozen or more extra mouths distributed around their body. Though their brute force is formidable, this demon also inflicts raw psychic pain by wailing from their mouths in different voices-often the agonized voices of souls the tormenauk has devoured.

**Lumbering egresses** are mobile masses of warped flesh set around an enormous whirling portal to the demonic realms. Lesser demons pour out through these portals at alarming rates, letting these creatures act as devastating siege engines.

###### Demon Malice (Level 4+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 4 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level or lower.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Abyssal Jaunt (3 Malice)**
>
> One demon acting this turn folds space around them, temporarily slipping in and out of the Abyssal Wasteland. Until the start of the demon's next turn, they ignore difficult terrain, can move through solid matter, and don't provoke opportunity attacks by moving. If the demon ends their turn inside solid matter, they are shunted out into the space from which they entered it.

### Demons-3rd Echelon

Demons of categories 7 to 9 continue to mutate in new and unpredictable ways, or are sometimes corrupted and spawned from other powerful creatures to become part of the demonic hierarchy. Additionally, in a plane of chaos, the soulraker demon is notable for fashioning a facsimile of order within themself. These demonic wasps make up a single, chaotic hive mind. They serve a demonic hivequeen, who relies on cannibalizing her children to ingest any souls they've consumed.

**Soulraker scouts** are the vile progeny of a soulraker hivequeen demonic wasps who emerge from her distended abdomen with an earsplitting buzz.

**Soulraker soldiers** are demonic wasps armored in dense chitin who favor driving foes before them.

**Soulraker stingers** are wasps covered in poisonous barbed stingers that they launch like quills, their wings atrophied and unusable.

**Blight phages** were once angelic creatures. Corrupted by demonic forces, each is now a cruel, distended mockery of a cherubic form, covered in pestilent boils that seep ruinous blight.

**Chimerons** (kai-MEHR-ons) are a horrifying amalgam of multiple demonic forms melded into a unique monstrosity, driven by an unslakable hunger for souls.

**Styrichs** (STEE-rix) feature lanky bodies covered with manes of long, razor-sharp hair, which they whip around the battlefield to shred their enemies.

**Soulraker handmaidens** are abyssal parasites implanted in victims by a soulraker hivequeen. Handmaidens gestate inside a host until they're ready to emerge from the body, then consume souls until they're strong enough to transform into a new hivequeen.

**Soulraker praetorians** are the elite guards of a hivequeen, dripping foul-smelling ichor and using their barbed stingers to lay waste to foes.

A **soulraker hivequeen** is a demonic wasp whose abdomen houses their own soulraker wasp hive, and whose stinging ovipositor implants victims with handmaiden parasites.

###### Demon Malice (Level 7+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 7 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**

> The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level 6 or lower.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Seeping Blight (5 Malice)**

As a maneuver, the handmaiden can emerge from the host as a horrifying tower of flesh and bone that remains attached to the host's insides. While emerged, the handmaiden can use a move action to make the host move up to their speed and has access to the host's signature abilities, using the host's modifiers for any power rolls. The handmaiden has the same Stability as the host. If the handmaiden or host is force moved, the other moves with them. While emerged, the handmaiden can be targeted independently of the host. The handmaiden can retreat totally within the host's body as a maneuver. If the handmaiden dies, their remains separate from the host.

### Demons-4th Echelon

The more souls a demon consumes, the more they evolve. The more they evolve, the more refined their tastes become, until eventually demons of category 10 can be satisfied only by consuming souls that exemplify particular qualities. Many demons of this category have their tastes honored by their titles, such as Gorgino, the Sensuous Feast; Tyx, the Obliviated Spiral; and Lorikta, the Discarded Dream.

**Optacus** (OHP-tih-cus) demons are abyssal eyes atop a spindly flesh stalk supported by innumerable legs. Able to affix to any surface, they shoot deadly beams of fire at distant foes.

**Tyburakis** (tee-berr-AH-kees) appear as a horrifying cross between a thresher shark and a terror lizard, their tails lined with tiny shark maws that allow them to bite multiple foes at once.

**Unguloids** (UHN-jyl-oids) have a centaur-like form, with a body and head resembling a demonic rhinoceros. They are known for their devastating charge.

**Izyaks** (ee-zi-YAHKS) have a mercurial form that ripples with psionic energy, making these demons appear different to all those who observe them. Their true form is a brain supported on four bone legs.

**Vicisitators** (vih-SIS-ih-tay-tors) are dangerous and horrifically unstable, the flesh and bone of their bodies trapped in a state of perpetual agonizing flux. Their very touch results in excruciating pain as it warps flesh, bone, and soul.

**Aurumvas** (or-UM-vahs) the demon king stands alone among named demons for craving not only wealth, but highly avaricious souls. A towering figure with a stack of crowns atop his ophidian head, he is a vision of opulence, excess, and absolute debasement. He lords over other powerful demons by virtue of the wealth held in his vast vaults in the Abyssal Wasteland, acquired through the slaughter of countless creatures. But even as he gazes upon his riches and supernatural treasures, Aurumvas wants for more. He draws lesser demons and wicked mortals to his service with the promise of minor treasures, knowing full well that one needs to spend wealth to make it. If left unchecked, Aurumvas's servile armies and glittering hoards might one day encompass the entire timescape.

###### Demon Malice (Level 10+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 10 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (3-7 Malice)**
>
> The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level 9 or lower.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Soul Flense (7 Malice)**
>
> One demon acting this turn unleashes their pent-up agony and pain on every non-demon in a 5 burst. Each target makes a **Presence test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 10 corruption damage; the target is soul flensed
> - **12-16:** The target is soul flensed
> - **17+:** No effect.
>
> **Effect:** The demon removes all conditions and effects on themself that can be ended by a saving throw, and transfers all those effects to each creature soul flensed this way.
