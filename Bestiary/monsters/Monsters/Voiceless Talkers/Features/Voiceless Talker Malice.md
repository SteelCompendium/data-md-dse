###### Voiceless Talker Malice

At the start of any voiceless talker's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Guise (3 Malice)**
>
> One non-minion voiceless talker projects a psionic screen over their body, preventing other creatures from treating them as an enemy until the end of the voiceless talker's next turn.

<!-- -->
> 🏹 **Memory Thief (5 Malice)**
>
> | Psionic, Ranged\*\* |        **Maneuver** |
> | ------------------- | ------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 5**     | **🎯 One creature** |
>
> **Power Roll + 3:**
>
> - **≤11:** 6 psychic damage; R < 1 the target can't treat their allies as allies (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 10 psychic damage; R < 2 the target perceives their allies as enemies (save ends)
> - **17+:** 13 psychic damage; R < 3 the target perceives their allies as enemies (save ends)
>
> **Special:** This ability can't be used by a minion.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Evolutionary Circuit (10 Malice)**
>
> All voiceless talkers link their minds, creating a circuit that empowers them while two or more voiceless talkers remain in the encounter. While this circuit is active, any psionic strike made by a voiceless talker deals an extra 5 damage. Additionally, when a non-minion voiceless talker takes damage, they can use a free triggered action to swap places with any voiceless talker minion on the encounter map. The minion takes the damage instead.
