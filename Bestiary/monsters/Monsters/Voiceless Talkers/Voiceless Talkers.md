## Voiceless Talkers

Among the most powerful psions in the timescape, synlirii (*sin-LEER-ee*, singular: synliroi) are known as the "voiceless talkers" to the denizens of the World Below-and to surface dwellers unfortunate enough to encounter them. Descended from boneless aquatic cephalopods, they are alien in thought and motivation to the humanoid species they loathe. Synlirii consider the "barking ones" (their label for creatures who squeeze air through meat flaps to communicate) an abomination that must be corrected.

### Uneasy Alliances

Though synlirii and overminds are hereditary enemies, their mutual obsession with the barking ones often leads to uneasy alliances. Both synlirii and overminds employ humanoids from the World Below as agents, trading lore and technology for information on their surface foes.

### Olothec Hatred

The synlirii's visceral antipathy toward the barking ones is surpassed only by their deep enmity toward (and fear of) olothec. Ancient myths say that the olothec created both synlirii and overminds. To overminds, this is a harmless fable. But synlirii, who style themselves as the future masters of the timescape, rage against implications that their powers come from any source other than their own superior development.

### Psionic Spies

Despite their mental powers, voiceless talkers consider information their greatest weapon. They use their psionic talents to manipulate memory and perception, obscure their forms, and pass undetected among other cultures.

### Psi-Tech

Synlirii breed mollusks that secrete plastic-like substances, using them to fashion weapons and similar technology powered by psionic crystals. The voiceless talkers' handheld psionic pistols and portable psionic rifles can be activated only by their alien minds.

### Creature Engineers

Synlirii are obsessed with manipulating the natural development of other organisms. They create hulking brains, mindkillers, and other servants using a psionic technique they call the Interlace. Many synlirii experiments don't live long and aren't intended to. But the World Below is littered with unnatural creatures who escaped the voiceless talkers' Body Banks-most of them singular life forms who can't reproduce and might never die.

### Graywarper

Graywarpers are voiceless talkers who were drained of most of their psionic abilities-and free will-as punishment for insolence or incompetence. They are viewed solely as expendable tools who enhance the power of other voiceless talkers.

### Hulking Brain

The voiceless talkers have engineered pearlescent-skinned, humanoid-shaped horrors with four massive arms and a large pulsing brain in place of a head. Called thylin√ßa by voiceless talkers and hulking brains by everyone else, these creatures serve as bodyguards and psionic batteries for their synlirii creators.

### Mindkiller

Floating clawed brains with a trailing spinal column and nerves, mindkillers serve as the voiceless talkers' pets and lackeys. These amorphous parasites can force themselves into a humanoid's body through the ear, eye, or nose, then devour the victim's central nervous system while replacing it with their own tissue. When the process is complete, the mindkiller gains all the victim's knowledge and memories and can puppet their body, becoming the perfect spy for the mindkiller's synlirii overlords.

Mindkiller whelps are a lesser form of mindkiller who can be created in a fraction of the time. While they can't inhabit bodies, their mere presence weakens their foes' mental defenses against psionics.

### Voiceless Talker Languages

Most voiceless talkers communicate telepathically using Mindspeech and speak Variac.

###### Voiceless Talker Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of any voiceless talker's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> üë§ **Guise (3 Malice)**
>
> One non-minion voiceless talker projects a psionic screen over their body, preventing other creatures from treating them as an enemy until the end of the voiceless talker's next turn.

<!-- -->
> üèπ **Memory Thief (5 Malice)**
>
> | Psionic, Ranged\*\* |        **Maneuver** |
> | ------------------- | ------------------: |
> | **üìè Ranged 5**     | **üéØ One creature** |
>
> **Power Roll + 3:**
>
> - **‚â§11:** 6 psychic damage; R < 1 the target can't treat their allies as allies (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 10 psychic damage; R < 2 the target perceives their allies as enemies (save ends)
> - **17+:** 13 psychic damage; R < 3 the target perceives their allies as enemies (save ends)
>
> **Special:** This ability can't be used by a minion.

<!-- -->
> üåÄ **Evolutionary Circuit (10 Malice)**
>
> All voiceless talkers link their minds, creating a circuit that empowers them while two or more voiceless talkers remain in the encounter. While this circuit is active, any psionic strike made by a voiceless talker deals an extra 5 damage. Additionally, when a non-minion voiceless talker takes damage, they can use a free triggered action to swap places with any voiceless talker minion on the encounter map. The minion takes the damage instead.
