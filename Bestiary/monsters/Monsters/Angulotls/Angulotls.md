## Angulotls

Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa-LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they're threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.

#### Deadly Toxins

Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression-because they don't need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.

#### Indicator Species

Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn't take much to upset that balance. While toxins don't kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path-even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most-and sometimes grants them strange abilities.

#### Moisture Dependent

Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it's raining.

#### Clawfish

Known as q'ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.

#### Angulotl Languages

Most angulotls speak Filliaric.

#### Wet

Angulotls make use of a unique effect called "wet." While wet, an angulotl doesn't provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.

###### Angulotl Malice

At the start of any angulotl's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Leapfrog (3 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, when an angulotl moves through an inactive angulotl's space, the inactive angulotl can use a free triggered action to jump 3 squares.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Resonating Croak (5 Malice)**
>
> Each angulotl in the encounter puffs out their throat and starts loudly droning Any non-angulotl adjacent to an angulotl makes an **Intuition test.**
>
> - **≤11:** 5 sonic damage; slowed (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 4 sonic damage
> - **17+:** No effect.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Rainfall (7 Malice)**
>
> An angulotl calls clouds to cover the encounter map and unleash rain until the end of the round. Any creature or object that is exposed to the sky is wet until the end of the encounter.

###### On Angulotls

<!-- -->
> They like humans! Adults tend to freak them out a little. I don't think they realize tall humans are the same species as tiny humans!

###### Angulotl Tactics

<!-- -->
> **Angulotl Tactics**
>
> Angulotls are not generally aggressive, and if confronted, a patrol of frog folk will usually exchange a few blows before performing a harrying retreat to their hidden villages. In defense of their homes, however, they become much fiercer and more determined. In these battles, angulotls try to force fights in or near water to take advantage of their amphibious nature and the wet effect.
>
> Simple patrols are usually made up of slippery captains leaping into the backline and harassing low-Stamina heroes while their minion hordes keep higher-Stamina heroes engaged. In larger engagements their tactics become more defensive to protect their high-value units. They tend to stay in close and coherent groups to take advantage of support abilities.
