###### Olothec Malice

At the start of an olothec's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (4 Malice)**
>
> The olothec takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🗡 **Writhing Envelopment (4 Malice)**
>
> | **Melee, Strike, Weapon** |                                      **Main action** |
> | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------: |
> | **📏 Melee 3**            | **🎯 One slimed, transformed, or devolved creature** |
>
> **Power Roll + 4:**
>
> - **≤11:** 11 psychic damage; A < 2 grabbed
> - **12-16:** 17 psychic damage; A < 3 grabbed
> - **17+:** 20 psychic damage; A < 4 grabbed
>
> **Effect:** The olothec can pull a target grabbed this way adjacent to them. While grabbed this way, a target can't make saving throws to end any other effects, and the olothec has a double edge on strikes against them.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Memory of Chaos (6 Malice)**
>
> The olothec broadcasts their memory of the universe in its primordial state-a sweeping cacophony of transcendental irrationality and unceasing change. Until the end of the encounter, any creature who starts their turn within 3 squares of the olothec and has R < 3 is dazed and slowed until the end of their next turn).
