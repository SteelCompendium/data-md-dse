## Xorannox the Tyract

Xorannox the Tyract is an overmind. Formally known by their endonym, vaurath (plural: vaurathi), overminds plot and scheme against their chief rivals, the synlirii and the olothec, for control of the World Below.

#### Psionic Eyes

An overmind is an enormous floating brain with a large central eye surrounded by many smaller embedded eyes. Even more alien, several psionic eyes float within inches of their head, each connected to a small brain that can manifest a unique psionic effect.

#### Intelligent Loremasters

Like their rivals, overminds are loremasters of supreme intellect. They aren't usually wizards, but they all view the collection of knowledge and arcane sciences as the best tool for ultimate conquest. Overminds are cruel and capricious but enjoy tests of intellectual might. Their one vanity is their unshakable belief in their own intellectual superiority over all others.

#### Overmind Lairs

Thanks to their innate flight, overminds prefer to build (or rather, have their thralls build) towers with no doors or entrances anywhere near the bottom.

#### Rivalries and Negotiations

Unlike the synlirii and the olothec, overminds have an intense hatred of their own kind and never work together. However, overminds often enjoy diplomacy with other species, seeking to form alliances and build secret networks of agents throughout the World Below.

#### Smelly Eggs

Overmind procreation involves one horror laying a single egg in a slime pool and leaving it behind. When another overmind later detects the distinct smell of the egg, they spray their inseminating fluid into the pool. These actions are compelled by biological necessity, a compulsion even the overminds can't ignore.

Unwitting explorers sometimes accidentally abscond with an egg. If unfertilized, its bearer is likely to attract the attention of other overminds and synlirii that use the eggs in genetic experiments to create psionic creatures. If the egg is fertilized, the explorer could find themselves becoming a newly hatched overmind's first victim.

#### Xorannox the Tyract

Xorannox (*ZOR-ah-nocks*) rules as Lord of the White Tower, an isolated, multilevel finger of alabaster stone connecting to the World Below. He is commonly known as the Tyract, an ancient Za'hariax word that literally translates as "a king who rules with his teeth"-and the overmind indeed consumes those who displease him.

Xorannox is chief of the Grasp, a secret organization that seeks to overthrow the voiceless talkers' great empire and place Xorannox above all, first as king, then as god. The Tyract is a master strategist, always one step ahead of his enemies. Heroes may be surprised to discover their allies are members of the Grasp. When they meet Xorannox, he's delighted! He loves treating with humanoids! They have the same enemies, after all.

Unfortunately, no matter how useful or dependable a party of heroes might be, Xorannox is nearly incapable of resisting the urge to betray his allies. He assumes, as do most vaurathi, that the natural end of all alliances is betrayal. Thus when the gauntlet is thrown and his life is in danger, the only minions he can truly trust are his own six eyes.

#### Xorannox's Languages

Overminds typically speak Za'hariax. Xorannox also speaks Caelian, Hyrallic, and Voll.

###### Xorannox's Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of Xorannox's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->

> Xorannox lets out a noxious belch. Each enemy within 2 squares of him who has M < 3 is weakened (save ends).

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Slime Trail (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of Xorannox's next turn, whenever he or any of his eyes leave their space, they secrete a viscous slime onto the ground in that area. Any enemy who enters an affected square has lightning weakness 5 and fire weakness 5 until the end of the encounter.

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> Xorannox takes an additional main action on his turn. He can use this feature even if he is dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Mind Over Matter (7 Malice)**
>
> Xorannox fills the encounter map with a powerful telekinetic field. The Director chooses a cardinal direction (north, south, east, or west). Whenever a creature in the encounter willingly moves or is force moved, they are pulled 2 squares in the chosen direction, ignoring stability. Each time this feature is used, its previous effect ends.
