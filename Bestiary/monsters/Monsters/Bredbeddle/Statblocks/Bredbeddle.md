> ☠️ **Solo Monster**
>
> **End Effect:** At the end of each of their turns, the bredbeddle can take 5 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.
>
> **Solo Turns:** The bredbeddle can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Heady or Not**
>
> While headless, the bredbeddle can move into a space containing a severed head and attach it to their neck as a main action. Doing so physically transforms the bredbeddle, who takes on the appearance, size, weight, and stability of the head's original owner. If the bredbeddle takes the form of a creature of size 1L or smaller, the distance of their melee and burst area abilities decreases by 1. These effects last until the bredbeddle is killed or beheaded, or until the head falls off after 24 hours. A head that falls off this way can no longer be attached to this bredbeddle.
>
> A creature must succeed on a **hard Might test** made as a maneuver to rip a head off the bredbeddle. If they fail, the bredbeddle can make a free strike against them.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Resilient Form**
>
> The bredbeddle can't be physically transformed in any way except by their Heady or Not trait.

>
> **Effect:** A beheaded target has their head fall into an unoccupied square adjacent to the bredbeddle, but they remain alive. While beheaded this way, the target is bleeding and has line of effect only to adjacent squares. The beheaded target can survive without their head for 24 hours, and can reattach their head as a maneuver by entering its square. A target who remains beheaded for 24 hours dies.

> **Effect:** While the bredbeddle is headless, they shift up to their speed. Each time a creature comes adjacent to the bredbeddle during the shift, the bredbeddle can push that creature 1 square. Each square the bredbeddle exits during the shift is difficult terrain.

If the target accepts the challenge, the bredbeddle shifts adjacent to the target, who makes a **Might test** with no additional modifiers.
