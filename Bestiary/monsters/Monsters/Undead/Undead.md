## Undead

Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.

Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people's fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.

### Dark Places

For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun's golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.

### Encountered Together

Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don't need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.

### Corporeal Undead

At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can't think beyond the orders of their creators-unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren't controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.

The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.

### Spectral Undead

Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person's vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer's fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.

Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.

<!-- -->
> **Spectral Undead and Phasing**
>
> All spectral undead have some kind of phasing trait that enables them to move through creatures and objects at their usual speed. However, they can't end this movement inside a creature or object while in combat. Outside of combat, a spectral undead might hide themself inside a statue, painting, or other object. But when battle begins, they can't remain within or fall back to that cover to prevent being attacked.

### Undead Languages

Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life.

### Undead-1st Echelon

It's rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren't careful.

###### **Undead Malice (Level 1+ Malice Features)**

At the start of any undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Ravenous Horde (2 Malice)**
>
> At the end of this round, each hero not already adjacent to one or more undead is beset by two **rotting zombies** who burst up from the ground to appear in adjacent unoccupied spaces. Each zombie is winded. This feature can't be used two rounds in a row.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Paranormal Fling (3 Malice)**
>
> Up to three unattended objects on the encounter map rise to float 1 square off the ground. Each object is then pulled 5 squares toward the nearest enemy within 3 squares of the object.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **The Grasping, the Hungry (5 Malice)**
>
> Ravenous and rotting undead arms burst forth from 9 connected squares of a vertical or horizontal surface. Any creature who ends their turn adjacent to an affected square makes an Agility test.
>
> - **≤11:** 5 damage; restrained (save ends)
> - **12-16:** 5 damage; restrained (EoT)
> - **17+:** 5 damage
>
> **Effect:** While restrained this way, a creature takes 1d6 damage at the start of each of their turns.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Dread March (7+ Malice)**
>
> Up to four undead in the encounter move up to their speed and can make a free strike. The number of undead affected increases by 1 for each additional Malice spent on this feature. If an undead is reduced to 0 Stamina during this dread march, they don't die until the march is resolved.

### Undead-2nd Echelon

More powerful and more self-aware forms of undead rise above the undead horde and lay claim to dark, isolated domains all their own. The longer an undead is allowed to thrive, the stronger they become.

#### Mummies

Mummies are humanoids raised from the dead through a complex series of magical rituals. The process tethers a creature's soul to their earthly body, preventing them from crossing into true death. As part of the mummification process, a corpse is embalmed and wrapped in cloth imbued with necromantic power. Mummification is reserved for situations of grave import. A great hero might voluntarily be mummified upon death to eternally guard future generations or a holy relic. On the other hand, a great villain could be mummified to prevent them from escaping their crimes through death.

#### Vampire Spawn

Vampirism is a curse of blood that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life that nonetheless hunger for life's essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims.

Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their living forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves. A vampire's power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and their master's orders. Few spawn survive long enough to become true vampires.

#### Mournlings

Powered by sorrow and rage, these hulking amalgamations of dirt or flesh defend the homes of their creators, brutally attacking intruders while sobbing uncontrollably. Mournlings express far more emotion than many other undead guardians, for their makers imbued them with sadness and loss. Though their druidic creators are long-dead, some original mournlings still defend forests, mead ows, and other natural places they were built to protect.

Outside of battle, mournlings patrol for interlopers in a trance-like state. When an unknown creature creates a disturbance or approaches them, the mournling unleashes a primal cry that conveys the very essence of suffering, then bursts into violence. They continue to sob and moan even as they viciously beat their enemies to a pulp.

###### Undead Malice (Level 4+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 4 or higher undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (2-7+ Malice)**
>
> The undead activates a Malice feature available to undead of level 3 or lower.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Blood Hunger (5 Malice)**
>
> One undead acting this turn uses a signature ability against a creature who is bleeding. As a free triggered action, each undead within 5 squares of the first undead moves up to their speed and can make a free strike against the same target.

### Undead-3rd Echelon

Older, taboo methods of creating devastating undead wildly vary from one another. These wretched creatures can come about by way of accursed blood rituals, terrible operations, a spirited collective resistance to death, or other unspoken methods once thought lost to time.

#### Koptourok

Koptourok is a Variac name that roughly translates to "dead tourist." It's given to those who meet their end suffocating in the depths, whether they drowned in a subterranean lake, wandered into a cave of trapped gas, or were crushed by a rockslide. These rasping, slouching undead rise from their grave desperate for the one thing they've lost: breath.

#### Haunt

Born of mass death events that leave multiple souls stranded in agony together, a haunt is a violent collective chaos driven by a hatred for the living. A haunt lays claim to the scene of their death, which their grief forbids them from leaving so as to strand them in the mundane world. None of the souls within a haunt are necessarily malicious, and all would individually prefer to move on and find peace. But their accumulated grief drives them to tremendous anger that inspires sadistic acts of violence against the living.

#### Waxen

When a corpse is preserved improperly, its body fat can become a substance known as corpse wax. Necromancers sometimes harvest and use this foul substance to enhance their undead minions, transforming them into waxens. These awkward, loping creatures cake their foes in foul-smelling wax to slow and sicken them. Waxen minions are often set ablaze by unscrupulous masters, sacrificing them to the flames but making them significantly more dangerous in the process

#### Vampires and Vampire Lords

By drinking the blood of a true vampire, a vampire spawn can transcend their feral beginnings and rise to become a true vampire themself. The path of transformation is daunting, and vampires who end up starved for blood often band together for mutual protection. But with patience and cunning, a vampire can grow old and powerful enough to control vast amounts of territory and countless vassals.

The term "vampire lord" thus refers not to a specific age or threshold of physical prowess, but rather to status and influence. A vampire who refers to themself as a lord invites challenges to their title and is prepared to crush all those who seek to end their reign.

###### Undead Malice (Level 7+ Malice Features)

At the start of any level 7 or higher undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (2-7+ Malice)**
>
> The undead activates a Malice feature available to undead of level 6 or lower.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Necrotic Rupture (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, whenever an undead is reduced to 0 Stamina, they deal 8 corruption damage to each enemy within 3 squares of them.

### Undead-4th Echelon

The deadliest of undead creatures can be placed into one of two categories: terrible machines that know only destruction, and powerful tyrants who aren't content with conquering just death.

### Bonecage

The weakness of many undead minions means that necromancers at war often find themselves shy of corpses when their forces lose more numbers than they slay. The bonecage offers a horrifi c solutio n t o thi problem. This hulking creature made from giants' bones is structured like a massive cage that they can cram dead and near-dead corpses into. Trawling the scenes of great battles, the bonecage fills themself with the fallen, stealing them away for ill purposes. Of course, when no mass casualty site presents itself, the bonecage is more than capable of making corpses of their own.

### Lithgekh

Every mage who lives long enough eventually contends with the fact that their knowledge will one day leave the world. For those who can't stomach this idea, seeking the immortality of the lich often becomes an irresistible temptation. But many of those who try and fail to achieve lichdom become lithgekh-a word in the First Language meaning "lich corpse." Having failed to create a proper soul vessel, a lithgekh suffers an eternal hunger for magic to sustain themself. Liches will sometimes trick or tempt mortal mages into pursuing lichdom, only to sabotage them and create a lithgekh under the lich's control. These servants are prized by liches for their ability to disrupt enemy magic and empower their own.

###### Undead Malice (Level 10 Malice Features)

At the start of any level 10 undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Prior Malice Features (2-7+ Malice)**

> The undead activates a Malice feature available to undead of level 9 or lower.

> **Special:** This ability can't be used by a minion.
