###### Ogre Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of any ogre's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Shockwave (3 Malice)**
>
> One ogre acting this turn jumps and lands on their rear, causing a 3 burst shockwave. Each size 1 creature in the area makes a **Might test** or **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 5 damage; vertical push 3
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; vertical push 2
> - **17+:** Push 1

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Bully (5 Malice)**
>
> Each ogre in the encounter shifts up to their speed and can make a free strike. If they can, they gang up on the same target rather than picking different targets.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Rampage (7 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, each ogre has damage immunity 5 and deals an extra 5 damage with abilities, and heroic abilities that target any ogre have their Heroic Resource cost reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1).
