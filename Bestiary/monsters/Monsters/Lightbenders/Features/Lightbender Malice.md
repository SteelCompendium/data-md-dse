###### Lightbender Malice

At the start of any lightbender's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Silent Prowl (3 Malice)**
>
> Each lightbender acting this turn can teleport up to their speed as a move action and attempt to hide as a free maneuver, all until the start of their next turn.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Duplicate (5 Malice)**
>
> Each lightbender acting this turn can create a duplicate lightbender in an unoccupied space adjacent to them. The duplicate is indistinguishable from the lightbender except by supernatural means, has 1 Stamina, and has the lightbender's speed. A duplicate acts on the lightbender's turn but can take only move actions. Once per round before or after using an ability, a lightbender can trade places with any lightbender duplicate.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Everything the Light Touches (7 Malice)**
>
> Each lightbender in the encounter shines radiantly, distorting the senses of any enemy within 5 squares of them. Each affected enemy makes a **Reason test**.
>
> - **≤11:** The target doesn't have line of effect to any lightbender (save ends).
> - **12-16:** The target doesn't have line of effect to any lightbender (EoT).
> - **17+:** No effect.
