## Lightbender

Lightbenders prowl deserts, plains, forests-any sunbathed wilderness where they can take advantage of the adaptations that make them skilled daylight predators. This monstrous creature's fur bends and refracts light from the surrounding environment, producing mirages that distract and confuse their prey.

#### Hidden Hunters

At a distance, a lightbender looks akin to a regular lion, but closer inspection reveals their glowing eyes, iridescent mane, and a pair of lashing tails spiked with refractive crystals. The lightbender's pelt magically warps light around them to disguise their movement, letting them teleport while leaving behind a past visual imprint. Unsuspecting prey rarely realize they're staring at an afterimage of the lightbender until the predator pounces.

#### Ghostly Echoes

Lightbenders can also bend the sounds they make, enabling them to almost completely disappear during a hunt. Many can delay their footsteps to slip into a silent prowl, while others might throw a guttural trill across a field to lure prey out of hiding. The lightbenders' illusory mastery was said to inspire several techniques taught to shadows within the College of the Harlequin Mask.

#### Protective Companions

Though lightbenders are typically solitary creatures, they sometimes cross into another lightbender's territory to help protect a newborn litter of kittens. A few people have succeeded in taming lightbenders as guards or hunting beasts, and if treated well, they can make loyal protectors, often viewing their smaller humanoid companions as surrogate kittens.

###### Lightbender Malice (Malice Features)

At the start of any lightbender's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Silent Prowl (3 Malice)**
>
> Each lightbender acting this turn can teleport up to their speed as a move action and attempt to hide as a free maneuver, all until the start of their next turn.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Duplicate (5 Malice)**
>
> Each lightbender acting this turn can create a duplicate lightbender in an unoccupied space adjacent to them. The duplicate is indistinguishable from the lightbender except by supernatural means, has 1 Stamina, and has the lightbender's speed. A duplicate acts on the lightbender's turn but can take only move actions. Once per round before or after using an ability, a lightbender can trade places with any lightbender duplicate.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Everything the Light Touches (7 Malice)**
>
> Each lightbender in the encounter shines radiantly, distorting the senses of any enemy within 5 squares of them. Each affected enemy makes a **Reason test**.
>
> - **≤11:** The target doesn't have line of effect to any lightbender (save ends).
> - **12-16:** The target doesn't have line of effect to any lightbender (EoT).
> - **17+:** No effect.
