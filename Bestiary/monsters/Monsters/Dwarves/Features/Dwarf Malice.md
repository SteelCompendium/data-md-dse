###### Dwarf Malice

At the start of any dwarf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Breaching Charge (3 Malice)**
>
> A dwarf can destroy one adjacent object or square of wall for each 3 Malice spent. Each enemy adjacent to the destroyed object or square takes the object's Stamina in damage (3 for wood, 6 for stone, or 9 for metal).

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Rappelling Barrage (5 Malice)**
>
> Each dwarf acting this turn can automatically climb at full speed while moving. At any point during this movement, they can make a free strike.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Snaring Line (7 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Magic, Ranged**      |               **Main action** |
> | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
> | **📏 10 x 1 line within 10** | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |
>
> **Effect:** Each target makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 8 damage; restrained (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 6 damage; slowed (EoT)
> - **17+:** No effect.
>
> The snaring line remains until the end of the encounter. Any enemy who moves into the area for the first time in a round or starts their turn there must make the test.
>
> **Special:** This ability can't be used by a minion.
