## Trolls

Ravenous trolls rampage through the wild to quell their fathomless hunger, leaving only destruction in their wake. Tall and gangly, they have mottled green skin covered by a mane of matted hair that runs down their neck and back. In many ways, they resemble massive humanoids, but their exaggerated features belie this comparison. A troll's lower jaw hangs unhinged and distended, and their long arms end in claws that drag along the ground as they walk.

### Hypermetabolism

A troll's constant hunger and aggression beget a life of violence. Like a grotesque miracle, they quickly assimilate consumed flesh into themselves to regenerate their body. Some scholars think this extreme metabolic process is the source of their hunger, but none know for certain which came first.

### Phases of Destruction

Fortunately for the ecosystems they inhabit, trolls can't be active all the time. Their natural behavior is to hunt relentlessly for a few days, then return to their dens to rest for as much as a week. Patient troll hunters can wait for this torpor and catch their quarry by surprise-though the cost of waiting can be high thanks to the damage a troll might do in the meantime.

### Strange Mutations

Trolls prefer to prey upon humanoids and animals, but stories tell of them feeding on fetid demons and undead, assimilating those creatures' flesh to magnificent and horrifying effect. A troll with loose hanging skin, curling nails, or exposed bone might be in better health than their appearance would suggest.

### Limbjumbles

When a suitably large piece of a troll is torn off in battle, it does its very best to keep on living. Deep-seated survival instinct goes into overdrive, causing the detached piece to sprout unthinkable assortments of malformed arms and legs. Though these limbjumbles are ultimately short-lived, they can often be found tumbling awkwardly behind living trolls.

<!-- -->
> **Mutating Your Trolls**
>
> At the director's discretion, a troll can mutate after consuming the flesh of any creature and gain some of their damage immunities, traits, abilities, and movement options. For instance, a troll who devours the carcass of a dead draconian might grow wings and gain their signature ability!
>
> Be aware that this can increase the difficulty category of an encounter while one or more of these mutated trolls are present-especially if their mutations enable them to deal more damage than normal or grant them an acid or fire damage immunity.

### Troll Languages

Most trolls speak High Kuric or Variac, while a few also know Caelian. Trolls are notably difficult to negotiate with unless heroes can provide more appetizing food than themselves.

###### Troll Malice

At the start of any troll's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Foul Spew (3 Malice)**
>
> One troll acting this turn spews out a half-digested meal in a 5 x 1 line within 1 square of them. Each troll in the area regains 3 Stamina. Each enemy in the area makes a **Might test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 12 acid damage; dazed (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 10 acid damage; weakened (EoT)
> - **17+:** 6 acid damage

<!-- -->
> 🗡 **Emergency Meal (5 Malice)**
>
> Each troll in the encounter can make a free strike against a creature adjacent to them, and regains Stamina equal to the damage dealt.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Bloody Banquet (7 Malice)**
>
> Each winded troll in the encounter disgorges the contents of their stomach onto the ground around them, creating a 1 burst of foul vomitus that lasts until the end of the encounter. Each non-troll who enters this area for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes 5 acid damage. Each troll in the area has a double edge on power rolls.
