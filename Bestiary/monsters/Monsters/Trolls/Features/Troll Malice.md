###### Troll Malice

At the start of any troll's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Foul Spew (3 Malice)**
>
> One troll acting this turn spews out a half-digested meal in a 5 x 1 line within 1 square of them. Each troll in the area regains 3 Stamina. Each enemy in the area makes a **Might test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 12 acid damage; dazed (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 10 acid damage; weakened (EoT)
> - **17+:** 6 acid damage

<!-- -->
> 🗡 **Emergency Meal (5 Malice)**
>
> Each troll in the encounter can make a free strike against a creature adjacent to them, and regains Stamina equal to the damage dealt.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Bloody Banquet (7 Malice)**
>
> Each winded troll in the encounter disgorges the contents of their stomach onto the ground around them, creating a 1 burst of foul vomitus that lasts until the end of the encounter. Each non-troll who enters this area for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes 5 acid damage. Each troll in the area has a double edge on power rolls.
