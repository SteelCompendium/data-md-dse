###### Wyvern Malice Malice Features

At the start of any wyvern's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🗡 **Simmering Anger (3 Malice)**
>
> One wyvern in the encounter can make a free strike against each enemy adjacent to them.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Boiling Fury (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, each wyvern in the encounter has a double edge on strikes and can use their signature ability instead of a free strike when making opportunity attacks.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Overflowing Rage (7 Malice)**
>
> Every wyvern's anger fills the encounter map with a thick miasma of hatred. Each enemy in the encounter makes an **Intuition test**.
>
> - **≤11:** The target is taunted by the nearest creature or object (save ends). While the target is taunted this way, power rolls against them have a double edge.
> - **12-16:** The target is taunted by the nearest creature or object (save ends).
> - **17+:** No effect.
