## Wyverns

The sight of a wyvern perched high atop a rotting tree or lit upon the jagged peak of a shadowy mountain marks the boundary between the known lands and forest primeval. There are raw, ancient sorceries in the wilderness that imbue those lands with power and hate older than roads and carts.

Though they superficially resemble dragons, wyverns are not dragons or dragon-kin. Distant relatives of the terror lizards of Ix, wyverns sport tough, leathery skin with hues running from brown to red to black depending on their native terrain. They are solitary creatures who track their prey by following the smell of fear they create.

#### Mountain Hunters

While on the hunt, wyverns perch on stone outcroppings and natural spires overlooking their territory. They first attack with their stinger, injecting prey with corrosive acid. If a wyvern's victim attempts to hide, the wyvern's hooked claws and fearsome teeth can tear open any crag or crevice in pursuit.

#### Acidic Aggressors

Without front limbs to grasp their prey, wyverns prefer to keep their distance and strike with their long, stinger-tipped tails. A single sting is usually enough to kill common game outright, and even larger foes are left wracked by pain. Wyverns have no interest in drawn-out struggle, and they relentlessly sting their foes at every opportunity.

#### Protective Parents

A wyvern's infamous temper is easily provoked, particularly if their eggs or hatchlings are threatened. Many monster slayers for hire won't accept contracts to track and hunt wyverns during hatching season. Yet this season is when heroes are needed most, as mated pairs aggressively hunt anything or anyone to feed their young.

#### Communicating with Wyverns

Wyverns are unable to speak. However, a clever hero carrying a feast of fresh meat might be able to reason with one.

###### Wyvern Malice Malice Features

At the start of any wyvern's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🗡 **Simmering Anger (3 Malice)**
>
> One wyvern in the encounter can make a free strike against each enemy adjacent to them.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Boiling Fury (5 Malice)**
>
> Until the end of the round, each wyvern in the encounter has a double edge on strikes and can use their signature ability instead of a free strike when making opportunity attacks.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Overflowing Rage (7 Malice)**
>
> Every wyvern's anger fills the encounter map with a thick miasma of hatred. Each enemy in the encounter makes an **Intuition test**.
>
> - **≤11:** The target is taunted by the nearest creature or object (save ends). While the target is taunted this way, power rolls against them have a double edge.
> - **12-16:** The target is taunted by the nearest creature or object (save ends).
> - **17+:** No effect.
