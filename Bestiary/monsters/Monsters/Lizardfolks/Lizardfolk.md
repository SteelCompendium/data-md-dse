## Lizardfolk

Lizardfolk prefer warm, tropical climates, but they're willing to settle in any humid region-the more moisture in the air, the better. Even in colder environs, lizardfolk can be found in any sufficiently marshy environment. Bogs and wetlands are particularly common nesting grounds.

#### Homeland Protectors

Lizardfolk aren't especially hostile unless they feel their territory is threatened-which it often is. Respectful travelers entering lizardfolk territory, however, find no great hardship. Lizardfolk cultures often focus on a specific trade, such as boat building, fletching, navigating, or weaving, and sell their services to travelers in need, including lizardfolk from other places.

Adventurers often cross paths with lizardfolk while trekking through their homelands. The reptilian humanoids watch travelers who skirt too close to sources of food and shelter, attacking those who take more than they need. Many lizardfolk dwell in abandoned ruins and caverns for protection. Treasure seekers who delve into these places are typically given one warning before the attack begins.

#### Focused and Loyal

Most lizardfolk speak plainly, viewing blunt honesty as a sign of respect. When they make a vow or personal promise, they do all they can to honor that word. Lizardfolk who swear to destroy an enemy follow their quarry to the ends of the earth.

#### Marshland Tyrants

In times of crisis, such as a food shortage, an evil lizardfolk leader can exploit the emergency, oppressing others in the name of defending their territory. But there are always other local lizardfolk tribes who oppose such aggressive, expansionist posturing, and they often seek the aid of other folk who value freedom from tyranny.

> **Lizardfolk Tactics**
>
> Lizardfolk prefer to fight in or near water whenever they can, and if they aren't on a battlefield with water, they perform delaying actions to buy time while they flood the battlefield with their Malice features before attacking with full force. If water is already present, they focus on positioning in the early battle to surround and split up their opponents.
>
> With a wide array of strong grab and forced movement abilities, lizardfolk tactics are that of divide and conquer, locking down strong defenders while abducting and isolating backline heroes. Lizardfolk also have strong teamwork features and rotate units who have lost their tails to more rear positions in favor of healthier units.
>

###### Lizardfolk Malice

At the start of any lizardfolk's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> **Net Trap (3 Malice)**
>
> | **Area, Ranged, Weapon** |   **Maneuver** |
> | ------------------------ | -------------: |
> | **📏 1 cube within 3**   | **🎯 Special** |
>
> **Effect:** A lizardfolk acting this turn sets up a net trap into the area. The first time an enemy steps into a square with a net trap, they make an **Agility test**. If the creature was unaware of the trap, they take a bane on the test.
>
> - **≤11:** Restrained (save ends).
> - **12-16:** Restrained (Eot).
> - **17+:** No effect.
>
> **Effect:** Any creature not also restrained by a net trap who is adjacent to a creature restrained by the trap can free them as a maneuver.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Water Pit (5 Malice)**
>
> A lizardfolk acting this turn unearths a magical size 2 pit that is 2 squares deep and filled with water. Any lizardfolk who moves into, then exits the pit on their turn gains 10 temporary Stamina, regrows their tail if applicable, and ends one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. While adjacent to the pit, any creature who can burrow or who has the Nature skill can make a **Might test** or a **Reason test** to drain it.
>
> - **≤11:** The creature falls into the pit and is knocked prone.
> - **12-16:** The creature fails to empty the pit.
> - **17+:** The pit empties of water.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Flood the Shores (7 Malice)**
>
> Waist-high water floods the entire encounter map. Any lizardfolk submerged in water gains an edge on abilities and doubles their speed while swimming. If there are no open water pits on the encounter map, the water drains away at the end of the round.
