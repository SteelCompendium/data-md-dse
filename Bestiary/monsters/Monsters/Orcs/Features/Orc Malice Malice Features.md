###### Orc Malice Malice Features

At the start of any orc's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Overwhelming March (3 Malice)**
>
> Each orc shifts up to their speed, moving through enemy spaces if they can. Each enemy passed through during this movement makes a **Might test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 6 damage; prone
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; prone
> - **17+:** Push 2

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Mohler Trench (5 Malice)**
>
> An orc acting this turn summons 2 **mohlers** out of the ground, who dig a trench that is a 10 x 1 line within 10 squares when they appear. The trench is 2 squares deep and is difficult terrain. The trench can't be created directly underneath creatures.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Mohler Cavity (7 Malice)**
>
> The ground shakes as a group of mohlers dig a 5 cube pit beneath an area where at least one creature is on the ground. The area is difficult terrain. Each orc in the area can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the pit before it is completed. Each nonorc in the area makes an **Agility test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 4 damage; the target falls; prone and can't stand (EoT)
> - **12-16:** 4 damage; the target falls
> - **17+:** The target can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the pit.
