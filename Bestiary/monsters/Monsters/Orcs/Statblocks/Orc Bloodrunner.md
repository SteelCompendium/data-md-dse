> The bloodrunner can end their movement in a prone creature's space. The first time on a turn that a bloodrunner enters any creature's space, that creature takes 3 damage.

> If the bloodrunner is reduced to 0 Stamina, they can make a free strike before dying. If the target of the free strike is reduced to 0 Stamina, the bloodrunner is reduced to 1 Stamina instead.
