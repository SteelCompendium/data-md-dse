> ☠️ **Solo Monster**

> **End Effect:** At the end of each of their turns, the werewolf can take 5 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.
>
> **Solo Turns:** The werewolf can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Accursed Rage**
>
> The werewolf's ferocity is expressed through rage, and their abilities can inflict rage points on any enemy except a stormwight fury. A creature who starts their turn with 10 or more rage expends their rage. Then before taking their turn, they must shift up to their speed toward the nearest creature and make a melee free strike against them. A creature who takes damage from this free strike gains 1 rage. Accumulated rage disappears after a character finishes a respite

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Shapeshifter**
>
> The werewolf enters combat in their hybrid humanoid form. Their shape can't be changed by any external effect

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Vukenstep**

> **2 Malice:** If the target has P < 0, they are afflicted with lycanthpy. Each time the target is unaffected by the potency effect, the potency increases by 1 the next time the werewolf uses the ability against the same target. A creature afflicted with lycanthrop gains 2 rage at the end of each of their turns whenever they're in combat. Their rage doesn't disappear after finishing a respite and they must complete the Find a Cure downtime project in "Draw Steel: Heroes" to end this effect
