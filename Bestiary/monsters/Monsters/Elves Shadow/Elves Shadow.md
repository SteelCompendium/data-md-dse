## Elves, Shadow

Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.

Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden's topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all.

#### In Equinox's Shadow

Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold's eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.

#### Manifold Weaponry

The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.

#### Brush Stalkers

When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers-quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves.

A brush stalker's glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.

#### Fractured Factions

Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.

#### Duskcalling

Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.

A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.

#### Shadow Tactics

Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they'll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can't benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.

In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children's game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.

#### Shadow Elf Languages

Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.

###### Shadow Elf Malice

At the start of any shadow elf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Watch Me Disappear (3 Malice)**
>
> Each shadow elf acting this turn can attempt to hide as a free maneuver if they have concealment.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Extra Dimension (5 Malice)**
>
> When any shadow elf acting this turn makes a strike against a target who has I < 2 in addition to the strike's regular effects, the target is bleeding (save ends) or slowed (save ends).

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Home Is Where the Hurt Is (10 Malice)**
>
> The shadow elves synthesize a concentrated pocket manifold reminiscent of Equinox and graft it onto the encounter map. Until the end of the encounter, all creatures can see shadow elves in full color, and shadow elves no longer benefit from their Of the Umbra trait. Additionally, the potency of all shadow elf abilities increases by 2, and any enemy making a saving throw against an effect imposed by a shadow elf ability must roll an 8 or higher as they feel the effect across two worlds.

###### Shadow Elf Deployments

**Shadow Elf Deployments**

When under order of the Shadow Queen, shadow elf missions outside of Equinox are usually short, dangerous, and targeted. They rarely last more than a week or two, and the force often appears in Orden not far from their target. Mission goals trend towards the nefarious-kidnapping, assassination, theft, and general skullduggery are the order of the day.

However, not every shadow elf force is affiliate d wit h th queen. Some are exiled rebels plotting their return, others independent groups searching for lost magic to restore their world, and yet others have left Equinox permanently to seek new lives in the caverns and deep woods of Orden. No matter their affiliation , these groups will brook no attempts to thwart their goals and are all deadly warriors.
