###### Minotaur Malice

At the start of any minotaur's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Bull Rush (3 Malice)**
>
> For each 3 Malice spent, one minotaur acting this turn gains a +4 bonus to speed and ignores difficult terrain until the start of their next turn.

<!-- -->
> 👤 **Cut the... Nonsense! (5 Malice)**
>
> One minotaur acting this turn halves any damage they take, and can use the Knockback maneuver as a free triggered action whenever an enemy comes adjacent to them, all until the start of their next turn.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Bullseye (7 Malice)**
>
> All minotaurs in the encounter fill the area around them with psychic impressions of feeling lost and isolated. Each enemy within 5 squares of a minotaur is teleported up to 5 squares and makes an **Intuition test**.
>
> - **≤11:** The target has line of effect only within 3 squares and is frightened of all minotaurs (save ends).
> - **12-16:** The target has line of effect only within 3 squares (EoT).
> - **17+:** No effect.
