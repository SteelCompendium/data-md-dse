> **End Effect:** At the end of each of their turns, the dragon can take 15 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.
>
> **Solo Turns:** The dragon can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Deathcount**
>
> Several of the dragon's abilities impose a Deathcount on a target. At the end of every turn, a creature with a Deathcount who is within the area of the dragon's Stagnant Wyrmscale Aura has that Deathcount reduced by 1. When a creature's Deathcount hits 0, they die. If multiple Deathcounts are imposed on a creature, they don't stack. Only the lowest Deathcount takes effect. All Deathcounts are lost when the dragon is reduced to 0 Stamina.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Stagnant Wyrmscale Aura**
>
> The dragon's scales create a 4 aura of supernatural stagnancy around them. The area is difficult terrain for enemies, and no creature except the omen dragon can regain Stamina while in the area. Any creature dragonsealed by the omen dragon who starts their turn in the dragon's aura and doesn't have a Deathcount gains a Deathcount of 12.
