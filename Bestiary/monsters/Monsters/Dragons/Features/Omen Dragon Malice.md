###### Omen Dragon Malice

At the start of an omen dragon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Black Skies (3 Malice)**
>
> The dragon expands their wings to create a shroud of shadow. Until the start of the dragon's next turn, any strike made against them takes a bane.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Rise and Fall (5 Malice)**
>
> The dragon flies up to 10 squares and carries fated souls with them. Each creature in the area of the dragon's Stagnant Wyrmscale Aura trait makes a **Presence test**.
>
> - **≤11:** Vertical pull 10
> - **12-16:** Vertical pull 6
> - **17+:** Vertical pull 4

<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Solo Action (5 Malice)**
>
> The dragon takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Burn It Right Down (10 Malice)**
>
> Each edge of the encounter map burns with intangible purple flames until the end of the encounter. The flames expand by 1 square at the end of every turn. Any enemy takes 5 corruption damage for each square of flames they enter.
