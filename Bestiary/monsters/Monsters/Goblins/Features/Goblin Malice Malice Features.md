###### Goblin Malice Malice Features

At the start of any goblin's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Goblin Mode (3 Malice)**
>
> Each goblin in the encounter gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the round.

<!-- -->
> ❇️ **Tiny Stabs (5 Malice)**
>
> Each enemy in the encounter takes 1 damage for each goblin adjacent to them.

<!-- -->
> 🌀 **Swamp Stink (7 Malice)**
>
> The encounter map is covered in a green mist that lasts until the end of the round, and which can't be dispersed by wind. All areas of the map are difficult terrain for non-goblins, and each non-goblin on the map makes a **Might test**.
>
> - **≤11:** 5 poison damage; the creature is weakened until the mist disappears.
> - **12-16:** The creature is weakened until the mist disappears.
> - **17+:** No effect.
