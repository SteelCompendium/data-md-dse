## Draconians

Draconians-wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden-are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training.

Six individual draconians are presented in this section-not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.

###### Aeolyxria the Uncanny

From the moment she hatched, Aeolyxria (ay-oh-LIX-ree-ah) has enjoyed a fascination with the occult. She wanders the land, gathering strange tomes and artifacts to study. When she takes a job, it's because she has a new doohickey she wants to test out. Aeolyxria possesses a sharp, tactical mind that lets her treat any battlefield as if it offered homefield advantage. If she could just get a handle on all her equipment, she'd be unstoppable!

###### Locratix the Morningstar

A traveler from a faraway land and the sole progeny of her Dracogenesis clutch, Locratix (low-CRA-tics) focuses on survival over all other things. The very concept of the dragon knights is anathema to her, as there is no reason a wyrmwight should hand over the power that keeps them alive. Locratix travels widely while taking on mercenary jobs, but she is always just one better deal away from skewering her present employer on the end of her lance.

###### Lydixavus the Deadeye

Nothing escapes Lydixavus (lee-DIX-uh-vas) or their unrivaled precision. After decades of careful training, they have honed their breath weapon into a swift and far-traveling bullet of ice. Lydixavus is motivated by revenge. Each scar, each dent in their scales tells a story, and Lydixavus aims to return those gifts tenfold to those who bestowed them.

###### Myxovidan the Sintaker

Myxovidan (mix-OH-vih-din) was raised by a secluded order of monks who claimed his obsidian-black scales and nausea-inducing breath were an evil that must be purged. They subjected him to an austere lifestyle, full of intense training, meditation, and denial of worldly pleasures. But Myxovidan's hunger would be satisfied, one way or another. When Myxovidan departed the order, he left behind a collection of emaciated monk corpses who looked as though they'd had the life sucked out of them.

###### Phrrygalax the Subduer

Phrrygalax (fuh-RIJ-ih-lax) was once a dragon knight in the service of Good King Omund. Though he took the oath to defend others against tyranny, he was always keenly aware he was created for violence. When the betrayal of the dragon knight Mandrake fractured the Dragon Phalanx that was the order of the dragon knights, Phrrygalax gleefully renounced his oath to follow what he believes to be his true, brutal purpose. Many who served with him believed he was merely waiting for a convenient excuse to do so.

###### Dorzinuuth the Base

To those who know the Dragon Phalanx of old, no name inspires more awe and fear than that of Dorzinuuth (dor-ZIN-yew-uth). A mastermind on the battlefield and the foundation of the dragon knights' fraternity, Dorzinuuth was known for mounting daring campaigns and always returning with the same number of soldiers and often alongside new recruits. In the wake of the death of Good King Omund, many were shocked to see Dorzinuuth debase himself with banditry and petty mercenary jobs. Others hold on to the hope that he makes unknown moves in darkness, waiting for the day when he can again uphold his oath in the light.

###### Draconian Languages

Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax. Aeolyxria speaks Caelian and the First Language. Locratix speaks Caelian and Oaxuatl. Myxovidan speaks Caelian and Axiomatic.
