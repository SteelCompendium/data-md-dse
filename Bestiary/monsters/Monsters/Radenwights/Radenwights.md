## Radenwights

The ratfolk known as radenwights are blessed with coordination and acrobatics so impressive and effective that they might be a highly trained and practiced circus act. They enjoy building their warrens, known as "meddles," under cities where the chaos of daily life makes raiding the people above fun and easy.

When the radenwights' enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they are painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever the ratfolk do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through for even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren't above banditry if it would support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.

### Bonds and Bravado

It's a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk, and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by running away or climbing to safety gets you only so far. Radenwights learn boldness from birth, and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community-as well as the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it's not one radenwight's blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows.

### The Magic of Music

The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among radenwights, though the community throws their support behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist whose playing enraptured an evil dragon-even as others in her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped on the creature from the cliff above.

### The Great Maclette

The name Maclette is never uttered by radenwights without "The Great" before it. That maestro leads his band in complex city-wide robberies while always staying one step ahead of any would-be ratcatchers. Some say Maclette leads his life of crime to provide for his meddle, while others claim he strives to be king of the criminal world.

In truth, the Great Maclette finds beauty in the thrill of the heist. Robbery is as euphonious as music to his ears, and the maestro treats every operation like a new composition. As long as his band remains at large, he'll always be looking to outdo himself with his next great overture.

### Radenwight Languages

Most radenwights speak Caelian and Szetch.

###### Radenwight Malice

At the start of any radenwight's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

<!-- -->
> 🔳 **Rally the Rodents (7 Malice)**
>
> A radenwight uses music to coordinate living rats, forming a 10 wall of rats scurrying atop one another into unoccupied spaces anywhere on the encounter map. The wall doesn't block line of effect for radenwights and their allies, but it does for other creatures as the rats coordinate their movements with the radenwights. Each square of the wall has 10 Stamina.
>
> If the last radenwight in the encounter dies and the wall is still standing, the rats let out a hideous screech as they disperse. Each enemy on the encounter map makes an Intuition test.
>
