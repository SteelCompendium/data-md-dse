# Demon Villain Power

At the start of any demon's turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features.

- **Soulburn (3 VP):** Every demon acting this turn deals additional damage equal to their level with their abilities and [[Free Strike|free strikes]].

- **Abyssal Rift (5 VP):** Two size 2 rifts to the Abyssal Wasteland appear at locations of your choosing. Each demon within 5 squares of a rift gains an edge on attacks. Any demon can use an abyssal rift as a portal to another abyssal rift in the encounter, moving into any space in one rift and appearing immediately in any unoccupied space in the other rift. Any non-demon creature who enters the rift for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes corruption damage equal to the level of the highest-level demon within 20 squares of a rift. An abyssal rift is an immovable object that has Stamina 25, weapon immunity 5, and holy weakness 5. As a maneuver, a creature who has the Magic or Psionics skill can make a hard Reason or Intuition test while adjacent to a rift to destabilize it. On a success, the rift closes. On a failure with a consequence, the rift regains 5 Stamina. If no demons are within 20 squares of the rift, it closes.

- **Abyssal Evolution (7 VP):** A demon minion of your choice turns into a non-minion demon of the same level.
