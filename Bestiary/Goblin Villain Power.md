# Goblin Villain Power

At the start of any goblin's turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features.

- **Goblin Mode (3 VP):** Each goblin in the encounter gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the round.

- **Tiny Stabs (5 VP):** Each enemy in the encounter takes 1 damage for each goblin who is adjacent to them.

- **Swamp Stink (7 VP):** The encounter map becomes covered in a green mist that lasts until the end of the round, and which can't be dispersed by wind. All areas of the map become [[Difficult Terrain|difficult terrain]] for non-goblins, and each non-goblin on the map must make a Might resistance roll.

  - ✦ ≤11: 5 poison; [[Weakened|weakened]] until mist disappears
  - ★ 12–16: [[Weakened]] until mist disappears
