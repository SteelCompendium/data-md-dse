        cost: +1 EV per hidey-hole
        effect: The hidey-hole is connected to a tunnel network. A creature familiar
          with the network can move from one hidey-hole to any space adjacent to
          a connected hidey-hole if they have movement available equal to the
          straight-line distance to that space. A creature unfamiliar with the
          network can use a maneuver to make a **hard Intuition test** to
          discover a connected hidey-hole.
