      - effect: "**Network (+1 EV per hidey-hole)** The hidey-hole is connected to a
          tunnel network. A creature familiar with the network can move from one
          hidey-hole to any space adjacent to a connected hidey-hole if they
          have movement available equal to the straight-line distance to that
          space. A creature unfamiliar with the network can use a maneuver to
          make a **hard Intuition test** to discover a connected hidey-hole."
