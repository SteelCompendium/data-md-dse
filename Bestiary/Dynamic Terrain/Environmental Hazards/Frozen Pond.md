        effect: The triggering creature's movement ends, then they are force moved. If
          the target triggered this ability by being force moved, this ability
          gains an edge and any remaining forced movement distance is added to
          the ability's forced movement. The ability's forced movement doesn't
          trigger the ability again.

      - name: Thin Ice
        cost: +1 EV
        effect: >-
          The ice covering the pond is thin and the water is deeper. Whenever a
          creature or object enters or falls prone in a square of the frozen
          pond, that square is destroyed and replaced with icy water. The **Icy
          Water** ability replaces **Slippery Surface**.

          Any creature who starts their turn in the icy water takes 1 cold
          damage. If the water is deep enough, a creature can swim beneath the
          surface of the frozen pond, but takes this cold damage while doing so.
