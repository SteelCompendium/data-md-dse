        effect: A portal fills the area, connecting to a location the vertex has
          experienced on any plane of existence, in person or otherwise. Any
          creature who enters the portal for the first time in a round or starts
          their turn there is instantly teleported to any unoccupied space in
          the portal at the chosen location. The portal lasts until the vertex
          uses this ability again, dismisses the portal (no action required), or
          is transported by the portal.
