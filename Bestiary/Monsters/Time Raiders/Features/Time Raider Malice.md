    type: Maneuver
    distance: 5 cube within 3
    target: Special
    effects:
      - effect: A time raider acting this turn activates a gravity well in the area. The
          gravity well sits at the center of the cube and lasts until the end of
          the encounter, or until a creature adjacent to the well uses a
          maneuver to deactivate it. The area is difficult terrain for enemies.
          Any enemy who ends their turn in the area is pulled up to 4 squares
          toward the well.

          and can teleport up to their speed as a move action.
  - name: Psi-Cage
    icon: üåÄ
    cost: 10 Malice
    effects:
      - effect: All time raiders in the encounter collectively create a psionic field
          over the encounter map, which lasts until the first time raider with
          the highest Stamina maximum drops to 0 Stamina or chooses to end the
          field (no action required). While the field is up, each non-time
          raider on the map makes a **Reason test** against this psionic effect
          at the start of each round.
        t1: 10 psychic damage; slowed (EoT)
