    target: Special
    effects:
      - name: Special
        effect: The area extends from both the basilisk's eyes, and this ability targets
          the first creature without cover on either side of the area.
      - roll: Power Roll + 2
        t1: M < 0 restrained (save ends)
        t2: M < 1 restrained (save ends)
        t3: Slowed (save ends); or if M < 2 restrained (save ends)
      - effect: If a target is already slowed, the potency increases by 1 for that
          target. A target restrained this way magically begins to turn to
          stone, and a target who ends two consecutive turns restrained this way
          is petrified. A target restrained this way or a creature adjacent to
          them can use a main action to cut encroaching stone from the target's
          body, dealing 8 damage to the target that can't be reduced in any way
          and ending this effect.
