        t2: 10 acid damage; pull 2
        t3: 14 acid damage; pull 3
      - effect: This ability can pull targets restrained by Petrifying Eye Beams, and
          ignores stability if it does so.

          targets the first creature without cover on either side of the area.

      - roll: Power Roll + 2
        t1: A < 0 restrained (save ends)
        t2: A < 1 restrained (save ends)
        t3: Slowed (save ends); or if A < 2 restrained (save ends)
      - effect: If a target is already slowed, the potency increases by 1 for that
          target. A target restrained this way magically begins to turn to
          stone, and a target who ends two consecutive turns restrained this way
          is petrified. A target restrained this way or a creature adjacent to
          them can use a main action to cut encroaching stone from the target's
          body, dealing 8 damage to the target that can't be reduced in any way
          and ending this effect.
