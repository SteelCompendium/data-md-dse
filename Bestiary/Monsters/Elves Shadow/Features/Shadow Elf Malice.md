    feature_type: trait
    name: Extra Dimension
    icon: ‚≠êÔ∏è
    cost: 5 Malice

  - type: feature
    feature_type: trait
    name: Home Is Where the Hurt Is
    icon: üåÄ
    cost: 10 Malice
    effects:
      - effect: The shadow elves synthesize a concentrated pocket manifold reminiscent
          of Equinox and graft it onto the encounter map. Until the end of the
          encounter, all creatures can see shadow elves in full color, and
          shadow elves no longer benefit from their Of the Umbra trait.
          Additionally, the potency of all shadow elf abilities increases by 2,
          and any enemy making a saving throw against an effect imposed by a
          shadow elf ability must roll an 8 or higher as they feel the effect
          across two worlds.
