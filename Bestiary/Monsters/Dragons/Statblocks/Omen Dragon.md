traits:
  - name: Solo Monster
    effects:
      - effect: At the end of each of their turns, the dragon can take 15 damage to end
          one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage
          can't be reduced in any way.
        name: End Effect
      - effect: The dragon can take two turns each round. They can't take turns
          consecutively.
        name: Solo Turns
  - name: Deathcount
    effects:
      - effect: Several of the dragon's abilities impose a Deathcount on a target. At
          the end of every turn, a creature with a Deathcount who is within the
          area of the dragon's Stagnant Wyrmscale Aura has that Deathcount
          reduced by 1. When a creature's Deathcount hits 0, they die. If
          multiple Deathcounts are imposed on a creature, they don't stack. Only
          the lowest Deathcount takes effect. All Deathcounts are lost when the
          dragon is reduced to 0 Stamina.
  - name: Stagnant Wyrmscale Aura
    effects:
      - effect: The dragon's scales create a 4 aura of supernatural stagnancy around
          them. The area is difficult terrain for enemies, and no creature
          except the omen dragon can regain Stamina while in the area. Any
          creature dragonsealed by the omen dragon who starts their turn in the
          dragon's aura and doesn't have a Deathcount gains a Deathcount of 12.
  - name: Death or Victory
    effects:
      - effect: Once per turn, the dragon chooses one creature with a Deathcount within
          line of effect. That creature can choose to take 1d6 damage and lose a
          recovery to increase their Deathcount by 5.
  - name: Black Skies
    effects:
      - effect: The dragon expands their wings to create a shroud of shadow. Until the
          start of the dragon's next turn, any strike made against them takes a
          bane.
  - name: Rise and Fall
    effects:
      - effect: >-
          The dragon flies up to 10 squares and carries fated souls with them.
          Each creature in the area of the dragon's Stagnant Wyrmscale Aura
          trait makes a **Presence test**.

          - **â‰¤11:** Vertical pull 10

          - **12-16:** Vertical pull 6

          - **17+:** Vertical pull 4
  - name: Solo Action
    effects:
      - effect: The dragon takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use
          this feature even if they are dazed.
  - name: Burn It Right Down
    effects:
      - effect: Each edge of the encounter map burns with intangible purple flames until
          the end of the encounter. The flames expand by 1 square at the end of
          every turn. Any enemy takes 5 corruption damage for each square of
          flames they enter.
