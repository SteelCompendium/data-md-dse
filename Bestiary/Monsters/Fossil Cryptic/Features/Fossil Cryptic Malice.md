          of up to 5 squares. A creature in the area of a pillar before it
          appears is knocked prone on its surface. If the creature comes into

          encounter. Each enemy in the dust is suffocating. Additionally, at the
          end of each round, each enemy in the dust makes a **Might test**.
        tier1: Until the end of the enemy's next turn, their stability is reduced to 0,
          and any forced movement effects targeting them gain a +2 bonus to the
          distance moved.
        tier2: The enemy's stability is halved (EoT).
        tier3: No effect.
