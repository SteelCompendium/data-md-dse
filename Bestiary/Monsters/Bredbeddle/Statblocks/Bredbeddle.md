traits:
  - name: Solo Monster
    effects:
      - effect: At the end of each of their turns, the bredbeddle can take 5 damage to
          end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This
          damage can't be reduced in any way.
        name: End Effect
      - effect: The bredbeddle can take two turns each round. They can't take turns
          consecutively.
        name: Solo Turns
  - name: Heady or Not
    effects:
      - effect: >-
          While headless, the bredbeddle can move into a space containing a
          severed head and attach it to their neck as a main action. Doing so
          physically transforms the bredbeddle, who takes on the appearance,
          size, weight, and stability of the head's original owner. If the
          bredbeddle takes the form of a creature of size 1L or smaller, the
          distance of their melee and burst area abilities decreases by 1. These
          effects last until the bredbeddle is killed or beheaded, or until the
          head falls off after 24 hours. A head that falls off this way can no
          longer be attached to this bredbeddle.

          A creature must succeed on a **hard Might test** made as a maneuver to
          rip a head off the bredbeddle. If they fail, the bredbeddle can make a
          free strike against them.
  - name: Resilient Form
    effects:
      - effect: The bredbeddle can't be physically transformed in any way except by
          their Heady or Not trait.

        t3: 16 damage; bleeding (save ends); or if the target has M < 3 they are
          beheaded
      - effect: A beheaded target has their head fall into an unoccupied square adjacent
          to the bredbeddle, but they remain alive. While beheaded this way, the
          target is bleeding and has line of effect only to adjacent squares.
          The beheaded target can survive without their head for 24 hours, and
          can reattach their head as a maneuver by entering its square. A target
          who remains beheaded for 24 hours dies.

          exits during the shift is difficult terrain.

          shifts adjacent to the target, who makes a **Might test** with no
